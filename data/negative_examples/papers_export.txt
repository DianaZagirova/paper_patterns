TITLE: Theory in Religion, Aging, and Health: An Overview

ABSTRACT: This paper provides an overview of theory in religion, aging, and health. It offers both a primer on theory and a roadmap for researchers. Four "tenses" of theory are described--distinct ways that theory comes into play in this field: grand theory, mid-range theory, use of theoretical models, and positing of constructs which mediate or moderate putative religious effects. Examples are given of both explicit and implicit uses of theory. Sources of theory for this field are then identified, emphasizing perspectives of sociologists and psychologists, and discussion is given to limitations of theory. Finally, reflections are offered as to why theory matters.

TITLE: HIV and Aging: Time for a New Paradigm

ABSTRACT: The population of patients with HIV infection achieving viral suppression on combination antiretroviral therapy is growing, aging, and experiencing a widening spectrum of non-AIDS diseases. Concurrently, AIDS-defining conditions are becoming less common and are variably associated with outcome. Nonetheless, the spectrum of disease experienced by those aging with HIV remains strongly influenced by HIV, its treatment, and the behaviors, conditions, and demographics associated with HIV infection. Our focus must shift from a narrow interest in CD4 counts, HIV-RNA, and AIDS-defining illnesses to determining the optimal management of HIV infection as a complex chronic disease in which the causes of morbidity and mortality are multiple and overlapping. We need a new paradigm of care with which to maximize functional status, minimize frailty, and prolong life expectancy. A composite index that summarizes a patient's risk of morbidity and mortality could facilitate this work and help chart its progress.

TITLE: Can aging research generate a theory of health?

ABSTRACT: While aging research and policy aim to promote 'health' at all ages, there remains no convincing explanation of what this 'health' is. In this paper, I investigate whether we can find, implicit within the sciences of aging, a way to know what health is and how to measure it, i.e. a theory of health. To answer this, I start from scientific descriptions of aging and its modulators and then try to develop some generalizations about 'health' implicit within this research. After discussing some of the core aspects of aging and the ways in which certain models describe spatial and temporal features specific to both aging and healthy phenotypes, I then extract, explicate, and evaluate one potential construct of health in these models. This suggests a theory of health based on the landscape of optimized phenotypic trajectories. I conclude by considering why it matters for more candidate theories to be proposed and evaluated by philosophers and scientists alike.

TITLE: Subjective wellbeing, health, and ageing

ABSTRACT: Subjective wellbeing and health are closely linked to age. Three aspects of subjective wellbeing can be distinguished-evaluative wellbeing (or life satisfaction), hedonic wellbeing (feelings of happiness, sadness, anger, stress, and pain), and eudemonic wellbeing (sense of purpose and meaning in life). We review recent advances in the specialty of psychological wellbeing, and present new analyses about the pattern of wellbeing across ages and the association between wellbeing and survival at older ages. The Gallup World Poll, a continuing survey in more than 160 countries, shows a U-shaped relation between evaluative wellbeing and age in high-income, English speaking countries, with the lowest levels of wellbeing in ages 45-54 years. But this pattern is not universal. For example, respondents from the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe show a large progressive reduction in wellbeing with age, respondents from Latin America also shows decreased wellbeing with age, whereas wellbeing in sub-Saharan Africa shows little change with age. The relation between physical health and subjective wellbeing is bidirectional. Older people with illnesses such as coronary heart disease, arthritis, and chronic lung disease show both increased levels of depressed mood and impaired hedonic and eudemonic wellbeing. Wellbeing might also have a protective role in health maintenance. In an analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we identify that eudemonic wellbeing is associated with increased survival; 29·3% of people in the lowest wellbeing quartile died during the average follow-up period of 8·5 years compared with 9·3% of those in the highest quartile. Associations were independent of age, sex, demographic factors, and baseline mental and physical health. We conclude that the wellbeing of elderly people is an important objective for both economic and health policy. Present psychological and economic theories do not adequately account for the variations in patterns of wellbeing with age across different parts of the world. The apparent association between wellbeing and survival is consistent with a protective role of high wellbeing, but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out at this stage.

TITLE: A comparison of two walking while talking paradigms in aging

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to [1] compare dual-task costs in gait and cognitive performance during two dual-task paradigms: walking while reciting alternate letters of the alphabet (WWR) and walking while counting backward by sevens (WWC); [2] examine the relationship between the gait and cognitive interference tasks when performed concurrently.
SCOPE: Gait and cognitive performance were tested in 217 non-demented older adults (mean age 76 ± 8.8 years; 56.2% female) under single and dual-task conditions. Velocity (cm/s) was obtained using an instrumented walkway. Cognitive performance was assessed using accuracy ratio: [correct responses]/[total responses]. Linear mixed effects models revealed significant dual-task costs, with slower velocity (p < .01) and decreased accuracy ratio (p < .01) in WWR and WWC compared to their respective single task conditions. Greater dual-task costs in velocity (p < .01) were observed in WWC compared to WWR. Pearson correlations revealed significant and positive relationships between gait and cognitive performance in WWR and WWC (p < .01); increased accuracy ratio was associated with faster velocity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that dual-task costs in gait increase as the complexity of the cognitive task increases. Furthermore, the positive association between the gait and cognitive tasks suggest that dual-task performance was not influenced by task prioritization strategies in this sample.

TITLE: Healthy ageing, resilience and wellbeing

ABSTRACT: The extension of life does not appear to be slowing, representing a great achievement for mankind as well as a challenge for ageing populations. As we move towards an increasingly older population we will need to find novel ways for individuals to make the best of the challenges they face, as the likelihood of encountering some form of adversity increases with age. Resilience theories share a common idea that individuals who manage to navigate adversity and maintain high levels of functioning demonstrate resilience. Traditional models of healthy ageing suggest that having a high level of functioning across a number of domains is a requirement. The addition of adversity to the healthy ageing model via resilience makes this concept much more accessible and more amenable to the ageing population. Through asset-based approaches, such as the invoking of individual, social and environmental resources, it is hoped that greater resilience can be fostered at a population level. Interventions aimed at fostering greater resilience may take many forms; however, there is great potential to increase social and environmental resources through public policy interventions. The wellbeing of the individual must be the focus of these efforts; quality of life is an integral component to the enjoyment of additional years and should not be overlooked. Therefore, it will become increasingly important to use resilience as a public health concept and to intervene through policy to foster greater resilience by increasing resources available to older people. Fostering wellbeing in the face of increasing adversity has significant implications for ageing individuals and society as a whole.

TITLE: Trauma, adversity, and biological aging: behavioral mechanisms relevant to treatment and theory

ABSTRACT: Although stress and adversity are largely universal experiences, people exposed to greater hardship are at increased risk for negative health consequences. Recent studies identify accelerated biological aging as a mechanism that could explain how trauma and adversity gives rise to poor health, and advances in this area of study coincide with technological innovations in the measurement of biological aging, particularly epigenetic profiles consistent with accelerated aging derived from DNA methylation. In this review, we provide an overview of the current literature examining how adversity might accelerate biological aging, with a specific focus on social and health behaviors. The most extensive evidence in this area suggests that health-compromising behaviors, particularly smoking, may partially explain the association between adversity and accelerated aging. Although there is relatively less published support for the role of social behaviors, emerging evidence points to the importance of social connection as a mechanism for future study. Our review highlights the need to determine the extent to which the associations from adversity to accelerated aging are consistent with causal processes. As we consider these questions, the review emphasizes methodological approaches from the causal inference literature that can help deepen our understanding of how stress and trauma might result in poor health. The use of these methodologies will help provide evidence as to which behavioral interventions might slow aging and improve health, particularly among populations that more often experience adversity and trauma.

FULL TEXT:

[Introduction]
In the 87 years since Hans Selye first integrated the concept of stress into the study of health [1–3], a wealth of empirical research now demonstrates that people who experience stress and adversity are at greater risk of illness and premature death [4–7]. Findings in this area link a wide array of stress and adversity exposures with numerous health outcomes that span disease states, organ systems, and the human lifespan [8, 9]. For example, compared to people who report less stress, people under greater stress are more likely to develop respiratory illnesses when exposed to the same viruses [10]. Similarly, people with greater stress show slower healing than less stressed people with the same wounds [11–13]. At a population health level, widowed adults are twice as likely to die during the week following their spouse’s death and almost three times as likely to develop heart disease [14, 15]. Despite convincing evidence that these associations are robust, identifying the biological processes that explain how adversity impacts the body has proven challenging. What psychological and behavioral processes activate or maintain disease-relevant physiology among people exposed to high levels of stress? Over the last decade, emerging empirical evidence points to biological aging as a multisystem physiological mechanism that could help explain how adversity translates to ill health, and the latest work in this area builds on critical stress-health associations observed over the last century.

Advances in the study of biological aging have coincided with a developing area of research focused on the study of health and aging, termed geroscience [16–18]. A key theme within geroscience is that aging is the strongest correlate of chronic disease and premature death [19]. In this framework, slowing aging—specifically the aging of the body, termed biological aging—has the potential to reduce the risk for disease and death across multiple organ systems, reducing disability and improving longevity as people grow older chronologically [19–23]. The value of biological aging as a mechanism linking stress to health is, in part, due its disease-agnostic nature, which better matches myriad published associations between stress and disease. This review summarizes the current literature linking stress, trauma, and adversity to biological aging, with a specific focus on behaviors that might explain this association, specifically social and health behaviors. We conclude by highlighting the limitations of the current literature linking adversity to biological aging and opportunities to move this area of research toward stronger causal inference that can ultimately support future theoretical and intervention advances.



[The many metrics of biological aging]
Biological aging refers to the progressive deterioration of physiological systems and functions that are required for survival [24]. Chronological age—that is, chronological time since birth—is not the same as biological age, and a major theme in modern geroscience is in identifying and studying heterogeneity in aging profiles and health decline [25–27]. Because many chronic diseases—e.g., cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, neoplastic diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease—are more common as people age chronologically, the search for markers of accelerated biological aging has garnered considerable scientific attention [28]. Work in this area includes but is not limited to, assessing changes in genomic stability and DNA methylation (DNAm), cell senescence, and mitochondrial functionality [28]. Telomeres, proteins protecting chromosome ends [29, 30], were among the earliest biomarkers of aging, and telomere length plays an important role in cellular senescence [31], with the shortening of telomeres reflecting accelerated biological aging. Leukocyte telomere length is associated with all-cause mortality [32], risk for cardiovascular disease [33], and risk for Alzheimer’s disease [34]. Importantly, psychosocial stressors are believed to play a role in accelerating telomere shortening via sympathoadrenal, neuroendocrine, and/or immune-inflammatory mechanisms that heighten oxidative stress and damage telomere ends [35]. Other metrics have proven useful in operationalizing biological aging, including the development of the pace of aging [36] and other equations [37, 38] that use biomarkers spanning multiple organ systems to characterize the coordinated deterioration of physiological function. For example, Belsky et al. [36] developed, refined [39], and validated a pace of aging metric in the Dunedin Study birth cohort across 19 biomarkers. They showed that the pace of aging for individuals in this cohort—all born in the same year and thus the chronological age since birth—was associated with cognitive and physical health decline in midlife.

As geroscience became increasingly interested in the dissociation between chronological and biological aging, technical advances in molecular sequencing technologies [27], especially the quantification of epigenetic DNAm, have led to the emergence of a series of methylation clocks [40, 41]. In brief, the extant clocks and methylation-based pace of aging metrics are based on DNAm of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides, which has direct relevance for RNA gene expression [28, 42]. Changes in epigenetic mechanisms are considered a hallmark of aging biology [17], though given the use of machine learning approaches to derive methylation measure algorithms, it is unclear whether epigenetic measures of aging are directly accessing biological aging or indirect, but useful, biological correlates [43].

Although it is beyond the scope of this review to detail all of the available epigenetic clocks (interested readers can see recent reviews, [41, 44]), we can summarize key trends in the literature as follows: (1) Following a series of seminal papers in 2013 [45, 46], several DNAm clocks emerged in the literature, many of which were trained to predict chronological age [27]; (2) Although many of the different clock metrics are correlated with each other and other aspects of biological aging, these correlations are often low and suggest that each clock measures different aspects of biological aging [44]. The first generation metrics, born from machine learning algorithms designed to predict chronological age, do not have clear links to the biology that underpins aging, which led to the development of second-generation clocks designed to more fully capture the functional changes associated with biological aging [47], some of which are specifically designed to predict mortality risk [48–50]. Most recently, epigenetic measures of aging have emerged that were directly trained on longitudinally assessed measures of biological aging, such as DunedinPACE [42], resulting in a third-generation of clocks—or perhaps a new category of DNAm measure altogether. These DNAm measures are increasingly used to predict mortality risk and healthspan [42, 51]. The ability to assess biological aging at a single point in time using DNAm, which would typically require costly and time-consuming longitudinal assessment, has allowed for a host of new social and behavioral research linking biopsychosocial predictors to health via accelerated aging.



[The many dimensions of adversity and associations with accelerated aging]
Adversity can be conceptualized a number of ways, spanning the type, timing, and duration of a stressful experience. The measurement of stress and adversity can include the assessment of exposure to stressful events or situations, as well as people’s subjective experiences of adversity, typically by measuring their perceptions of stress. Stressful events are measured in a variety of ways. One common method is counting the number of stressful experiences an individual has experienced, such as the number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; [52, 53]) or stressful life events [54–56]. More recently, there have been calls for integrative and detailed assessment of stressful events [57] to better capture the range and timing of stressors beyond counts [58, 59]. Despite measurement challenges, ACEs (abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction experienced by children) and stressful life event counts are linked to accelerated aging [55, 60, 61]. For example, experiencing common stressful life events is associated with changes in biological aging among adolescents [62]. However, stress constructs that assess specific events should not be considered exhaustive. Other common adversities linked to biological aging include growing up in socioeconomic disadvantage [63, 64], membership in a racial or ethnic minority group [65, 66], and discrimination [67]. For example, African American adolescents who had higher levels of perceived discrimination showered faster biological aging if they did not have a supportive family environment [68]. These broader measures of chronic adversity almost certainly play an important role in modulating the experiences of stress and aging across the lifespan.

A subset of stressful events—i.e., traumas, criterion A traumas, or traumatic events—are defined as particularly harmful and have the potential to cause posttraumatic stress disorder, a collection of symptoms related to re-experiencing traumatic events, avoiding reminders of trauma, and experiencing changes in cognition, mood, and arousal. The hyperarousal symptoms that contribute to the diagnosis of PTSD correlated with dysregulations in physiology, including changes to cardiovascular physiology and inflammation [69–72] and poor health. More recent work finds that the experience of trauma [73–75], as well as the development of PTSD [75, 76], are linked to accelerated aging. For example, in a sample of 339 trauma-exposed veterans, higher levels of PTSD hyperarousal symptoms were associated with high DNAm biological age [77]. Notably, associations of trauma and PTSD with accelerated aging span multiple methods of assessment. People with PTSD show accelerated aging as assessed by functional tests [78], telomeres [79], pace of aging [55], and epigenetic measures of aging (i.e., DNAm; [71, 73]).

The experience of stress and trauma can be contrasted with measures of adversity that seek to capture people’s subjective experiences of stress. The same event experienced by different people can have a different impact on health depending on individual characteristics, including genetic vulnerability to stress, personality, or availability of psychological services. Widely used measures like the Perceived Stress Scale [80] seek to capture people’s subjective feeling of stress and show consistent associations with biological aging [55, 81–84]. Stress perceptions are typically self-reported and have the advantage of being cost-effective and simple to administer. Notably, both stressful event counts and subjective perceptions of stress can vary across developmental periods with different relevance to aging. There is a necessary component of timing and duration implicit within the experience of adversity or stressful events, both in terms of acuity versus chronicity [85], and the specific timing within human development (e.g., spanning infancy, childhood, adulthood, midlife, and older age). Different rates of aging and epigenetic outcomes have been linked to adversity across many periods of the human lifespan [86–88], including slowed prenatal development of the central nervous system [89, 90], accelerated aging in childhood [86], and different rates of biological aging among older adults [91].



[Behavioral mechanisms linking adversity to accelerated aging]
It is widely known that early adversity and childhood stress are associated with poor distal health outcomes [92, 93], as is the experience of chronic psychological stress [8]. Although it is certainly the case that the experience of stress and trauma can have direct, dysregulatory effect on physiological systems in a manner that accelerates biological aging (cf. [94–104]), it is also likely that intermediate behaviors play a role in the causal chain from adversity to accelerated aging and poor health. Figure 1 provides a process model framework for understanding the ways in which stress, adversity, and trauma may portend behavioral changes that accelerate biological aging. Although it is possible to prevent some trauma and adversity from occurring or to reduce stress responses through treatment, it is impossible to prevent all stress and adversity. Identifying potentially health-relevant sequelae of adversity that could accelerate aging would present additional mechanistic targets for mitigating the adverse consequences of the stressful experiences. Here we present current evidence for two broad classes of potential mechanisms of action: social connectedness and health behaviors. Following Fig. 1, our review of the extant evidence on these topics is framed in terms of what we know about (a) the associations between adversity, stress, trauma and behavioral mechanisms, and (b) the associations between social/health behaviors and accelerated biological aging. We posit that changes in these potential mediating processes play a role in sculpting physiological responses that accelerate biological aging. In short, stress, adversity, and PTSD often alter our social relationships and health behaviors. High stress may have causal effects on social withdrawal and/or portend relationship conflict; it may disrupt sleep, and people may smoke to manage the adverse emotional experiences of the stress itself. In turn, these behaviors organize changes in physiological functioning that may alter genomic signaling in a way that contributions to illness and disease progression.Fig. 1Figure outlining links between adversity, social/health behavior, accelerated aging, and health.A Conceptual pathway linking adversity to health through changes in health behaviors, social behaviors, and subsequent changes in biological aging.

[Behavioral mechanisms linking adversity to accelerated aging - Social connection and disconnection]
Social connectedness is a multifactorial umbrella term that represents the degree to which people are and perceive themselves to be embedded in nurturing social relationships [105]. Included under the social connectedness umbrella are structural elements of social network properties (e.g., isolation or living alone) and social roles (e.g., marital status), functional components (including perceived social isolation, which is the definition of loneliness), and the quality of these close relationships (see [106]). The available evidence indicates that adversity, stress, and trauma are highly correlated with disrupted social relationship functioning in adulthood. Early social adversity plays a critical role in shaping infant and adult attachment orientations, which organize the mental models people hold about the reliability and trustworthiness of others in close relationships [107, 108]. Childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for the perpetration of intimate partner violence [109]. Socioeconomic adversity in childhood is a strong predictor of relationship dissolution in young adulthood, with evidence indicating early socioeconomic adversity predicts relationship dissolution directly as well as indirectly through interpersonal conflict and low levels of future orientation [110]. The available evidence also suggests that PTSD is highly associated with poor relationship functioning and increased risk for divorce [111–113], and this appears to be especially true for combat-exposed veteran populations [114]. In addition, meta-analytic and experimental evidence has indicated that PTSD both predicts and is predicted by low levels of social support [115, 116]. For example, Bourassa and colleagues found that exposure therapy increased perceived social support among active duty solders with PTSD in an experimental trial [116]. Finally, recent evidence suggests that, at the level of the US population, loneliness increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to pre-pandemic levels [117], and these disturbances in social functioning are hypothesized to play a role in shaping pandemic-related increases in mental health disorder [118].

Although the associations between adversity, stress, trauma and social relationship functioning are well established, the literature on social relationship functioning and accelerated biological aging is relatively nascent. When compared to married adults, those who are separated or divorced evidence shorter salivary and leukocyte telomere length [119, 120]. Interestingly, telomere shortening does not appear to mediate the elevated risk between marital status and cardiovascular disease mortality [119]. Relatively new research from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) suggests that perceived social support from and contact with close others, especially close friends, were prospectively associated with slower pace of aging (assessed via DunedinPoAm38) and lower GrimAge, two indices of epigenetic (DNAm) age acceleration [121]. Independent analyses with the HRS data provide a conceptual replication of these findings and find that the absence of marital and friend relationships are related to an older GrimAge and faster pace of aging [122]. The inability to establish peer relationships characterized by autonomy and relatedness in adolescence is also associated with older GrimAge at age 30 [123], and these variables accounted for nearly 8% of the variance in epigenetic age acceleration over and above variance accounted for by cigarette smoking and demographic factors. In a unique, but small (N = 40), study of work-related trauma exposures among paramedicine students, GrimAge acceleration was significantly lower among participants who reported increased social support at baseline and follow-up [124]. In a longitudinal study of African American adolescents in rural Georgia, Brody and colleagues [66] found that high family support moderated the relationship between experiencing racial discrimination and epigenetic age acceleration (at ages 20 and 22 years). Adolescents from high support families who experienced high and stable discrimination showed comparable age acceleration to people not experiencing discrimination, whereas those adolescents experiencing discrimination and having a low support family showed up to 2 years of epigenetic age acceleration on a first-generation DNAm clock. A family-based intervention research with the same cohort showed reductions in harsh parenting in the treatment condition was associated with reduced epigenetic age acceleration [67]. This finding, in particular, supports the hypothesis that social relationship functioning can serve as a critical mechanism linking life stress and biological age acceleration.



[Behavioral mechanisms linking adversity to accelerated aging - Health behaviors]
Health behaviors present some of the most plausible mechanisms that could explain how adversity accelerates biological aging, with extensive empirical support for the associations between adversity, unhealthy behaviors, and accelerated aging. Evidence for these associations exist across an array different adversities, unhealthy behaviors, and measures of aging across the lifespan. For example, childhood adversity is linked to unhealthy behaviors in midlife [125], as well as to smoking, physical inactivity, risky sexual behavior, problematic alcohol use, and problematic drug use in a meta-analytic framework [126]. The association between adversity and unhealthy behavior extends to later periods of life as well. Adults who report experiencing more stressful life events or higher levels of perceived stress are more likely to also smoke [127–129], have poor diet [130, 131], or be physically inactive [132, 133]. Older adults who experience interpersonal stressors, such as divorce or widowhood, are also more likely to be physically inactive or smoke [134–136]. Adversity is associated with less engagement with health protective behaviors as well—people exposed to more stress and adversity are more likely to endorse vaccine hesitancy [137] and may delay preventative healthcare [138, 139]. The broad associations between adversity and unhealthy behaviors also extend to trauma and PTSD. People with PTSD are at greater risk of smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet [140], and engaging in risky behaviors [140–142], though there is some evidence that these associations are explained by depressive symptoms [143]. The health behavior of sleep is notable as a possible link between PTSD and accelerated aging. Sleep disturbance is one of the central features of PTSD [144] and is associated with both PTSD [145–147] and stress, broadly speaking [148]. Notably, PTSD treatment improves sleep outcomes [149], suggesting an element of reversibility of this risk with efficacious PTSD treatment.

Health behaviors are perhaps the most robust predictors of biological aging, with the expectation that unhealthy behavior leads to poor health through accelerated aging, at least in part. Accelerated aging is associated with heavy alcohol use [150, 151], cannabis use [152], diet [153–157], physical activity [153, 158], and disturbed sleep [159]. Summarizing the extensive literature linking biological aging and health behaviors—even if limited to epigenetic measures of biological aging—is beyond the scope of this review. However, two points are notable. First, the associations between health behaviors and epigenetic measures of aging have initial evidence of reversibility. For example, Waziry and colleagues [156] found that caloric restriction was experimentally associated with slowed epigenetic aging in the CALERIE study, though the degree to which these changes are associated with improved long-term health is unknown. Evidence that changes in health behavior result in changes in aging measures would represent gold-standard evidence as to the most promising targets for future interventions attempting to slow aging among people experiencing adversity. Second, there is an extensive body of empirical evidence linking health behaviors to accelerated aging focused on smoking [50, 102–104, 160–163]. This includes evidence of broad associations [103, 160, 161], as well as changes in tissue specific to the lungs [102, 162]. For example, a recent study using the Health and Retirement Study found that lifetime history of exposure to cigarette smoke was associated with multiple epigenetic measures of aging, which helped explain the link between smoking and the development of chronic diseases and premature mortality [163]. Indeed, the association between smoking and biological aging is so well established that it is common for researchers to control for smoking status in studies or even in the creation of methylation clocks themselves. For example, methylation-derived pack years are included in the GrimAge clock’s calculation [50], due to the clear association between smoking and mortality risk. This creates a conundrum when studying stress, adversity, and accelerated aging; namely, smoking is likely both on the causal pathway linking adversity to aging [129], directly associated with changes in methylation (Fig. 1), and in some cases, included as part of the outcome being assessed [50]. Figure 2 illustrates how biological aging could change over time based on changes in smoking behavior related to adversity experienced across the lifespan. It is notable, however, that several studies find that indicators of stress and adversity, including PTSD [74, 76], remain associated with accelerated aging when controlling for smoking, suggesting that while smoking might help explain the association between adversity and aging, there are likely other mechanisms of action that require future study.Fig. 2Illustrative example of how childhood adversity and traumatic stress could accelerate biological aging by increasing risk for smoking across the lifespan, as well as how intervening to promote smoking cessation might help slow aging after people experience adversity.Paths that diverge at behavior change points (i.e., paths A–D) represent different theoretical rates of aging for different smoking behaviors (i.e., smoking initiation or not, smoking cessation or not) that could emerge among people who experience adversity.



[Incorporating the science of causal inference into the study of adversity and accelerated aging]
Although the associations between early adversity, psychological stress, trauma, and accelerated biological aging are well established, much of the work in this area is correlational; indeed, the same can be said for most of the research on the putative social and health behavior “mechanisms” that link these constructs. One of the main limitations—and areas of opportunity—in the study of adversity and aging is the lack of more rigorous studies that can speak to causal processes. Experimental studies and randomized controlled trials, of course, remain the gold standard for assessing the causality of adversity and associations with age acceleration (or any other health, health-relevant, or disease biomarker). As we discuss below, interventions can target the psychological consequences of adversity, or they can directly target the mechanisms that link life stress exposures to accelerated biological aging (see Fig. 1). With relatively few exceptions [67], however, this research has yet to be conducted in humans. Nevertheless, there exists a promising suite of tools for making better correlational inferences when relying on observational data [164–170], and our contention is that research on adversity and accelerated biological aging will benefit enormously by using these tools (cf., [171]). Table 1 includes several examples of the methods and potential applications to questions of causal inference in the study of adversity and accelerated biological aging.Table 1Illustrative listing of causal inference methodologies that could support deeper study of the association between adversity, stress, trauma, and accelerated biological aging.MethodBasic descriptionIllustrative examples for the study of accelerated biological agingaDirected acyclic graphs (DAGs)DAGs provide a visual illustration of causal assumptions and assist in identifying variables that need statistical control and situations where controlling for specific variables may worsen causal inferences [196].A DAG representation of the potential confounding influences from early life adversity to accelerated aging in midlife is used to identify collider variables that artificially strengthen the association.Propensity score analyses (PSA)In some situations, stress exposures are random; in other situations, especially in cases of adversity, life event exposures are non-random. Propensity scores allow researchers to condition on a set of covariates that are used to predict exposure to the traumatic experience. The resulting propensity scores can then be used as a means of matching exposed vs. non-exposed groups, or by weighting participants in terms of their likelihood of being exposed to a traumatic experience [170, 197].In a longitudinal study of combat-exposed veterans, propensity scores are used to examine the association between PTSD diagnoses and accelerated aging. Study participants are matched on their likelihood to experience PTSD. The results show that without propensity score matching (PSM), PTSD is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging. After PSM, the association between PSTD and accelerated epigenetic aging is not reliably different from zero.Instrumental variable (IV) analysisIV analysis is a method that helps account for unmeasured confounding in observational analyses. (Thus, whereas PSA methods account for measured confounders, IV methods account for unmeasured confounders.) IV estimation is based on a series of assumptions, the chief of which is that the instrument variable associated with the exposure is not associated with unmeasured confounds (see [198]). Increasingly, genetically-informed Mendelian randomization methods are used in health sciences as a form of IV analysis [199].A group of investigators use Mendelian randomization methods to study the bidirectional association between PTSD and a methylation-based pace of aging outcome. The results reveal significant associations from the pace of aging to PSTD but not the reverse, which raises questions about the directionality of extant associations in the literature.Natural experimentsNatural experiments occur when an event or condition affects a specific sub-population, creating a situation that is analogous to a randomized experiment and thus addresses many of the confounds inherent observational research [200]. There are many potential natural experiments in the stress-health literature, but the key is to ensure that the stress exposure is indeed random—e.g., comparing counties exposed to chronic stress of environmental contamination may seem like a natural experiment, but the question of whether such contaminations are random is open to debate.To the extent that government policies, environmental emergencies, or crises vary randomly, a study can address whether people living in counties or cities exposed to such stressors (vs. those who are unexposed) show accelerated biological aging. In many situations, the naturally-occurring event can be considered an instrumental variable—e.g., see [201] for a study of the Vietnam lottery draft as a means of estimating the causal effect of veteran status. In this case, the participants are drafted randomly and the lottery status is an IV for veteran status.Target trial emulation studiesBased on counterfactual theory, target trial emulation (TTE) methods attempt to recreate the conditions of a randomized clinical trial within observational data [202]. A key step in the TTE method is matching eligibility criteria within an observational data set, then following these people through some type of exposure to a pragmatic trial.TTEs involve [1] identifying a causal question from observational data in the form of a hypothesized RCT protocol, and [2] emulating the components of the protocol. For example, in a longitudinal research study of perceived stress, match participants in a manner consistent with an RCT protocol, then evaluate if changes in perceive stress are associated with changes in accelerated aging (see [203] for details on implementation).Sibling-comparison designsAmong a suite of quasi-causal within-family models, sibling-comparison designs offer a power test of causal life event exposure and other environmentally-mediated hypotheses [204]. Genes and environments are highly confounded—e.g., as a stress exposure, divorce is non-random, and thus studying its putative consequences (e.g., in the association between divorce exposure and biological aging) cannot rule-out the confounding role of genetics. Sibling-difference analyses represent a form of random genetic assignment during meiosis and can be a useful tool in assessing the environmental impact of within-family differences in stress exposures.In a large longitudinal study that includes full biological siblings, researchers investigate whether exposure to chronic interpersonal stress and strain is associated with accelerated biological aging. The sibling comparison model involves creating a within-family average of interpersonal stress and strain, then centering each sibling’s score on this metric relative to the family-level average. The main hypothesis centers on the extent to which siblings with elevated stress and strain scores (relative the family average) show more accelerated epigenetic aging.Cotwin control designsAmong a suite of quasi-causal within-family models, cotwin control designs provide another method that helps account for genetic confounding [191]. Cotwin control designs take advantage of the fact the monozygotic (MZ) twins share identical genotypes and when compared with dizygotic (DZ) twins, who share only 50% of their genetic material, this yields a biometric model that can help rule out genetic confounding in stress exposure to health outcome associations [192].In a sample of MZ and DZ twin pairs, researchers study whether differential exposure to high levels of subjective psychological stress is associated with prospective changes in accelerated biological aging. Within this design, researchers examine whether, after accounting for genetic influences in the stress-aging association, within twin-pair differences in chronic psychological stress remains a significant predictor of accelerated biological aging.G-ComputationThe nonparametric g(general) formula for estimating causal effects has many applications and is based on estimating the probability of an outcome under different hypothesized conditions based on different sets of control variables [170, 172, 205]. G-computation is based on counterfactual theory and the conditional probabilities of the outcome under different exposure conditions.Researchers are interested in the potential age acceleration consequences of caregiving stress, and outcome groups are created to classify participants into groups of people who do and do not show epigenetic age acceleration. Covariates include gender and a history of adverse childhood experiences. G-computation is completed on the marginal means to compare the age acceleration of those exposed vs. unexposed to caregiving stress under the different control conditions. The difference of these average probabilities is then calculated to create an estimate of the causal effect of caregiving on age acceleration.aThese examples are not drawn from the empirical literature; instead, they were created to illustrate the potential application of the methods outlined in this paper.

Two core themes in this literature are relevant to the current review. First, confounding is endemic in observational research and cannot be (fully) addressed by covariate adjustment alone [172–174]. Central to this theme is the idea that life event exposures are non-random, and any effort to understand the putative consequences of early adversity, mid-life discrimination, or combat-related trauma must contend with the individual differences and demographic variables. These individual characteristics almost certainly play a role in shaping who is exposed and how often they are exposed to stressful events, the impact of these stressors on behavior and functioning, and the potential biological age acceleration alleged to result from adversity. Second, all statistical methods make certain assumptions and these assumptions limit causal inference conclusions that can be drawn in any area of study. Consequently, researchers are increasingly calling for the triangulation of methodological and statistical approaches when dealing with questions of causal inference [175, 176]. For example, recent research on the effects of smoking on suicidal ideation and attempts compared the results of between-family analyses to those following Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, which is an effective method for evaluating residual confounding and potential reverse causation [177]; importantly, the observational/correlational analyses showed a strong positive association between the constructs, but the quasi-causal MR analyses showed no evidence for a causal effect. (It is important to keep in mind that any interpretation of these findings depends on the quality of the MR analysis. As a general conceptual framework, triangulation depends on the strength of the data that is informing the causal inference strategy. In other words, efforts toward triangulation depend not only on the assumptions of all the triangulating approaches (a broad feature of this work), but also the quality of the data available in a particular study (a specific limitation in the application of the method).

It is common for different methodological approaches to yield dissociated findings (and this is especially true when research incorporates analyses from between- and within-family models, see [168, 178, 179]) and triangulating across different approaches is a key element of scientific falsification [180, 181], the powerful idea that scientific advances unfold not through the slow accumulation of evidence in favor of an association of interest, but instead the inability to rule-out the plausibility of the association. Statistical methods that make different assumptions can provide increased opportunities for falsification, which can increase confidence in the robustness of a result. Alternatively, a lack of consensus across methods and the accumulation of discrepant findings during triangulation can provide the initial evidence that a single scientific paradigm is insufficient for solving the scientific question at hand [182], leading to new discoveries that challenge the status quo. When combined with modern causal inference analytic procedures (see Table 1), triangulation is a powerful conceptual tool for identifying causal effects. Importantly, the methods outlined in Table 1 are complementary—alone, none have the power to rule-out a causal effect and each method has a set of biases and assumptions; but when used together via triangulating approaches, especially in cases where RCTs are not possible, these methods are powerful.

What methods might be most helpful in moving the study of adversity and accelerated biological aging toward greater confidence in causal processes? We detail three approaches with the potential to help advance our understanding of this topic: RCTs targeting mechanisms of action, longitudinal mediational analyses, and twin studies.



[Incorporating the science of causal inference into the study of adversity and accelerated aging - Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting mechanisms of action]
The NIH Science of Behavior Change (SOBC; https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange) initiative was designed to move intervention science from a broad implementation of treatment packages (for health behavior change) to a focus on targeted mechanisms of action [183, 184]. Key components of this work involve showing that (a) interventions can engage those targets (referred to as target engagement), (b) that changes in these mechanistic targets yield changes in the outcomes of interest (referred to as target validation)—terms with origins from pharmaceutical development and the broad field of experimental medicine (see [185]). Related to the topic of adversity, trauma and accelerated aging, the goal of experimental research would be showing that targeting social relationship functioning or health behaviors could then slow biological aging. For example, among combat-exposed veterans with diagnosed PTSD, can cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) improve sleep and are improvements in sleep quality or duration associated with differences in accelerated aging? These interventions might be bundled with other treatment strategies, including those that focus on social functioning and/or medication, within the context of factorial experimental designs [186]. As the gold standard, increased use of RCTs seems a promising next step in the use of epigenetic aging measures.

Despite the promise of RCTs, it is important to note that using epigenetic aging outcomes in geroprotective trials has limitations, including questions about the reliability of measurement and periods required to observe meaningful changes in biological aging. Current epigenetic measures show variability in reliability of measurement that would make RCTs more challenging. For example, Higgins-Chen and colleagues reported that using principal-component (PC) adjusted clocks results in around 1.5 years of deviations between replicates [187]. Although an improvement over the 9 years found in non-PC adjusted clocks, this level of variability remains a barrier to detecting therapeutic effects. Similarly, the ideal timeline to detect clinically- or statistically-relevant change in epigenetic measures of aging is unclear, and any measurement strategy must be timed to capture the precise resolution of the causal change process [188]. For clock metrics trained on mortality, multiple years might be necessary to detect reliable change, limiting the value of RCTs that follow participants for under a year. Measures trained on physiological aging (e.g., DunedinPACE), might produce reliable change over a shorter period, however, this remains to be tested directly. These challenges are not unique to RCTs, but would make these studies challenging to conduct successfully given the cost and time involved in clinical trials. However, there is the potential that new clocks or PC approaches might produce measures that are more reliable in the future. If RCTs routinely collect methylation data, it would allow for future reanalysis of trials. Regardless of the ultimate method, linking changes in social and/or health behavior to changes in biological aging through RCTs or some other form of experimental intervention study would be critical to support theory and future intervention research aiming to slow biological aging.



[Incorporating the science of causal inference into the study of adversity and accelerated aging - Pursue longitudinal mediational studies]
Longitudinal mediation refers to models that help interrogate the extent to which intervening variables, termed mediators, explain the observed association between a predictor and outcome [189]. The most rigorous mediation models use multiple assessments of the relevant variables and can provide evidence as to the causal pathways that might link a broad risk factor, such as adversity, with aging or health outcomes via putative mechanisms of action. For example, a longitudinal cohort that assessed PTSD, perceived social support, and epigenetic aging at multiple occasions would allow researchers test whether people who develop PTSD evidence decreases in their perceived social support, which in turn predict accelerations in epigenetic measures of aging. Such approaches are particularly valuable in modeling change in mediators and outcomes that help overcome issues of temporal precedence and the directionality of associations. Although some studies are beginning to examine changes in aging at multiple occasions, much of the recent biological aging research has been limited to cross-sectional associations. As more longitudinal epigenetic data becomes available in longitudinal cohorts and laboratory studies, conducting more mediation analysis become feasible. For example, Wolf and colleagues recently found that GrimAge mediated the association between externalizing psychopathology and inflammatory phenotypes in a sample of 214 trauma-exposed military veterans [190]. Mediation analyses that examine whether a putative casual factor that explains the associations between exposure and outcome can serve as a valuable first step in determining future intervention targets. The use of longitudinal mediation models, particularly with multiple assessments of aging, health behavior, and social connection, would provide more stringent evidence as to how adversity might affect aging, albeit with limited ability to make specific causal claims.



[Incorporating the science of causal inference into the study of adversity and accelerated aging - Take advantage of cotwin control designs]
RCTs and longitudinal mediation are highly time and resource intensive study designs. As we note above, one of the challenges that emerges outside of RCTs is confounding; for example, it is quite possible that neuroticism is associated with both stress, adversity, and trauma exposures, as well as poor sleep and increased likelihood of smoking, all of which are associated with accelerated biological aging. Cotwin control designs [191, 192] are uniquely suited to examine genetic confounding. Applied to the example above, genetic confounding would operate when the genetics of smoking, for example, account for the phenotypic association between smoking and accelerated aging. Cotwin designs leverage the genetic relatedness of twins to create a counterfactual situation [193]. Because monozygotic twins share a genotype, a biometric decomposition that compares twins who are and are not exposed to a specific life event (or, who are differ quantitatively in their responses to life event exposures) allows research to control for genetic and shared environmental influences that may confound the exposure/outcome association. In this sense, cotwin designs provide a powerful falsification methodology that operates in many ways akin to a hierarchical regression analysis: After accounting for shared genetic and environmental influences between a putative exposure and outcome, do within-pair differences in twins’ exposure remain significantly associated with the outcome in question [191]? Figure 3 provides an illustration of a biometric cotwin model examining whether (within-pair) differences in stress exposure or life adversity are associated with metrics of accelerated biological aging (see Table 1 as well). This model specification allows us to examine whether an intrapair difference in a predictor variable (including, for example, discordance in PTSD diagnoses or quantitative differences in perceived stress) with an intrapair difference in a metric of epigenetic age acceleration. If the observed (i.e., phenotypic) association between the intrapair differences in X and Y remains significant after accounting for genetic and shared environmental confounds, the findings are consistent with a causal relationship and the estimated effect size of the association will be less biased because two major sources of confounding are attenuated/removed [191].Fig. 3Illustration of co-twin control model (bivariate Cholesky).The critical test of interest is the extent to which differences in social connection (sc) within a twin pair predict differences in a health outcome (ho) after accounting for genetic and shared environmental influences common to both variables.



[Using causal inference to advance theory and treatment]
How would the use of casual inference advance our knowledge of how stress, trauma, and adversity might accelerate biological aging? The value of causal inference is tied to the aims of the research program in question. Most studies of biological aging and adversity present statistical associations without the ability to make causal claims, however the objective of these findings are generally focused on one of two long-term targets— (1) better understanding the causal pathway that might link adversity to accelerated aging and poor health, i.e., theory, or (2) clinical interventions that are attempting to slow aging and improve health for people affected by high levels of stress, adversity, or trauma, i.e., prevention and treatment. Said differently, some programs of research aim to “carve nature at its joints,” whereas others are more agnostic about the reasons for causality and instead are focused on slowing aging in clinical settings. In the case of explicating the potential causal pathway from adversity to poor health, studies that are limited to associations, and particularly cross-sectional associations, cannot move the field towards causal inference. As stated above, statistical controls and temporal ordering can help limit alternative explanations for observed associations, but there are limits to how close observation studies can cleave to causal inference. Similarly, animal studies have an important role to play in the study of adversity and aging [193, 194], though drawing inferences from animal models comes with its own challenges [194, 195]. As a result, it is critical to move beyond findings that show broad associations between adversity and biological aging in humans if we wish to determine how adversity might cause more rapid aging and downstream health outcomes. Without using more sophisticated methods, describing the causal pathways from stress to health will remain challenging.

In the case of supporting interventions aiming to slow aging to improve health, the use of causal inference might appear less critical. Any association between stress and aging, or putative mediators, presents a plausible intervention target that might then be tested using RCTs as the gold standard methods of causality. The translational pathway—from observing broad risk, to evidence of mediation for plausible mechanisms, to testing interventions in an RCT framework—is defensible in the abstract and might achieve the stated goal of determining how to slow aging. However, it is notable that relatively few prospective RCTs have examined whether interventions slow aging generally (for an example, see the CALERIE trial, [156]), and fewer still among people who have experienced adversity or trauma. Although this may reflect the nascent nature of the area of research in this area, which might change as epigenetic measures of aging present a more realistic surrogate endpoint for use in RCTs, the cost and difficulty with running RCTs will remain, particularly given concerns with reliability and timeline when assessing epigenetic measures of aging [187]. Mechanisms of slowing aging that have evidence more closely approaching causal inference would presumably have a higher likelihood of a successful trial. Such evidence could be more convincing to the stakeholders necessary to fund and conduct aging interventions, including granting agencies, medical system administrators, and the clinicians delivering the interventions.



[Conclusions and future directions]
In this review, we have briefly summarized the state of the literature linking adversity to accelerated aging, including two behavioral mechanisms that might explain this association, social connection and health behaviors. Given the existing literature, there is a need to use rigorous methodologies to move observational studies stress and aging closer towards causal inference. The use of RCTS, longitudinal mediation models, and cotwin control designs, for example, would help provide more confidence that putative mechanisms—such as social and health behaviors—explain how adversity is linked to accelerated aging. This evidence would provide a stronger theoretical understanding of the causal pathways from adversity to accelerated aging and poor health, which would support future intervention efforts to slow aging and improve health among people who experience stress, trauma, and PTSD.

TITLE: The role of cellular senescence in ageing and endocrine disease

ABSTRACT: With the ageing of the global population, interest is growing in the 'geroscience hypothesis', which posits that manipulation of fundamental ageing mechanisms will delay (in parallel) the appearance or severity of multiple chronic, non-communicable diseases, as these diseases share the same underlying risk factor - namely, ageing. In this context, cellular senescence has received considerable attention as a potential target in preventing or treating multiple age-related diseases and increasing healthspan. Here we review mechanisms of cellular senescence and approaches to target this pathway therapeutically using 'senolytic' drugs that kill senescent cells or inhibitors of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Furthermore, we highlight the evidence that cellular senescence has a causative role in multiple diseases associated with ageing. Finally, we focus on the role of cellular senescence in a number of endocrine diseases, including osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as other endocrine conditions. Although much remains to be done, considerable preclinical evidence is now leading to the initiation of proof-of-concept clinical trials using senolytics for several endocrine and non-endocrine diseases.

TITLE: Ageing limits stemness and tumorigenesis by reprogramming iron homeostasis

ABSTRACT: Ageing is associated with a decline in the number and fitness of adult stem cells<sup>1,2</sup>. Ageing-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis<sup>3,4</sup>, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here we use physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered<sup>5,6</sup> mouse models and primary cells<sup>5,6</sup> to demonstrate that ageing suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading the stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by the ageing-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, which leads to functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescues stemness and promotes the tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells through ferroptosis induction. Ageing-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites is associated with increased NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells through DNA methylation inhibition. We uncover that ageing drives functional iron insufficiency that leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate at a young age, thereby highlighting the importance of directing cancer prevention efforts towards young individuals.

TITLE: The Aging Athlete: Paradigm of Healthy Aging

ABSTRACT: The Exercise Boom of the 1970's resulted in the adoption of habitual exercise in a significant portion of the population. Many of these individuals are defying the cultural norms by remaining physically active and competing at a high level in their later years. The juxtaposition between masters athletes and non-exercisers demonstrate the importance of remaining physically active throughout the lifespan on physiological systems related to healthspan (years of healthy living). This includes ~50% improved maximal aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and enhanced skeletal muscle health (size, function, as well as metabolic and communicative properties) compared to non-exercisers at a similar age. By taking a reductionist approach to VO<sub>2</sub>max and skeletal muscle health, we can gain insight into how aging and habitual exercise affects the aging process. Collectively, this review provides a physiological basis for the elite performances seen in masters athletes, as well as the health implications of lifelong exercise with a focus on VO<sub>2</sub>max, skeletal muscle metabolic fitness, whole muscle size and function, single muscle fiber physiology, and communicative properties of skeletal muscle. This review has significant public health implications due to the potent health benefits of habitual exercise across the lifespan.

TITLE: The Power of a Complex Systems Perspective to Elucidate Aging

ABSTRACT: It is becoming highly accepted that aging, age-related diseases, and geriatric healthcare can move forward if reductionist research is complemented by integrative research uniting knowledge on specific aging mechanisms, multiple biomedical, social, psychological, lifestyle, and environmental factors and their interactions. In this special issue, we present exciting papers that illustrate how complexity science theory and practice can be applied to aging research and provide a better understanding and quantification of healthy aging and vulnerability to disease. Recent insights on biomarkers, clocks of aging, frailty, and resilience are covered and studied in interaction with a dynamic multiscale perspective. The editorial and closing viewpoint guide you through basic principles of gerontological complexity science and shed light on new research horizons, including innovative systems-based interventions.

FULL TEXT:

[Novel Insights]
We aim to demonstrate this potential toolbox to elucidate new patterns in aging with this small, carefully selected collection of papers. For example, we might intuitively suspect that greater network connectivity indicates greater integration of systems and therefore better health; 2 of the articles in this collection suggest exactly the opposite. Hao et al. show that, among 71 biomarkers, network connectivity (correlations among elements) is increased in frail individuals (17). Koivunen et al. show that connections among intrinsic capacity domains increase with age and declining self-reported health (23). In both cases, it appears that during aging there is a loss of appropriate compartmentalization, necessary to buffer against the potential for one failing system to drag another down, leading to and explaining the cascade dropout of organs seen in many older persons with insufficient intrinsic capacity. This is consistent with findings of system collapse in other complex systems (eg, electricity grids, and ecological food webs), where accelerating variability and cross talk precede critical transitions between system states (ie, collapse) (24). Future work should begin to assess whether these conclusions replicate in other contexts, particularly across biological scales. If supported more broadly, this would suggest that maintenance of dynamic health during aging requires a holistic approach rather than a one-mechanism-at-a-time approach: key manifestations of aging such as frailty are not likely to have a single, etiologically unique explanation or pathway, but represent rather the cumulative manifestation of multiple compromised systems interacting on different scales.

Likewise, 2 articles appear to show that health depends on the maintenance of clear distinctions between physiological states to answer different contextual challenges, for example, between resting states and active responses to particular stimuli. Hong et al. examined the complexity of oxygenation and deoxygenation signals in the prefrontal cortex under different cognitive tasks, including innovative measures of complexity using neuroimaging data (21). Fast reaction time was best maintained in individuals that showed the greatest increase in complexity of both oxygenation and deoxygenation relative to baseline as task difficulty increased. Rudisch et al. examined differences in complexity of force fluctuations of manual manipulation that was either symmetric in both hands or coordinated differentially between hands, in both cognitively health individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment (20). They found more complexity in the symmetric task compared to the coordinated task, and that this difference was much more marked in cognitively healthy individuals. The traditional view is that maintenance of high complexity in biological signals is a sign of health and/or healthy aging (25); both these papers expand upon this view by showing that measures of complexity and their relation to health may depend upon the nature of the task. Health may require maintaining high complexity when appropriate, but low complexity may also be prioritized when appropriate, rather than uniformly investing in high complexity, relating to the notion of “reactive tuning” of certain systems during focused tasks (26). Although these 2 papers both deal with measures of signal complexity, we hypothesize that this finding applies more broadly: that we may not be able to arrive at broad principles for what health and healthy aging are in terms of systems dynamics, but rather that the definition of health will need to be empirical, context-dependent, and fit for evolutionary purpose.

Another notable feature of the articles in this special issue is their demonstration of the power of network analyses in domains where we might not previously have thought to apply them, particularly as regards metrics of aging. Pridham and Rutenberg applied dynamical network stability analysis to different measures of biological age and showed that a core measure of biological age, the “physiological age” proxy for cardiometabolic health, can be identified that seems to drive the others, such as epigenetic clocks (22). Koivunen et al.’s network analysis of different domains of intrinsic capacity showed changes in connectivity related to both age and self-reported health (23). Hao et al.’s analysis showed how networks of biomarker interactions relate to frailty (17). Mak et al. tested whether sequential measures of the frailty index (FI) and epigenetic clocks show bidirectional effects; most clocks showed no longitudinal association with FI whatsoever, but the DunedinPACE clock did predict subsequent FI, while the reverse was not true (16). Crucially, in most of these cases, there is not even a requirement that there be a plausible mechanistic scenario where the network involves clearly defined entities that directly interact with each other: the dynamics emerge even among abstractly defined constructs or among sparsely sampled subsets of larger networks (27), showing the robustness of such approaches.

Complex systems research is sometimes perceived as abstract and therefore insufficiently mechanistic or applied. The articles in this collection demonstrate the contrary, particularly in the context of falls. Langeard et al. show how detrended fluctuation analysis, a measure of complexity, can be applied to postural and cognitive data to predict fall risk in ways that traditional analysis cannot (18). Masters and Uiga provide a creative new approach to risk mitigation during falls: the hypothesis that simple, metaphoric mnemonic cues may be effective in reducing impact during falls and thereby mitigating harm (19). This is inspired by the notion of degeneracy in complex systems: the convergence toward a similar end state (safe landing) via a multiplicity of falling dynamics. They outline a program of research to explore this hypothesis and thereby nicely illustrate how embracing the paradigm of systems thinking may also result in new therapeutic options to be studied.



[Toward a System of Paradigms]
The complex systems paradigm is often perceived as mathematically and methodologically challenging and therefore intimidating, and it is indeed true that several of the featured articles do use or develop cutting-edge methods. However, we believe that the key innovation to be gained from applying complex systems theory to aging research is not in the specific methods, but in the change of perspective, and the accompanying change in the questions we ask. A crosscutting characteristic of the articles featured here is that they ask questions based on an understanding of organisms as complex dynamic systems undergoing aging; in no case would a simple, reductionist perspective have yielded these questions or the insights from the resultant papers. Once the proper question is identified, the methods can often be an afterthought. Measures of signal complexity can be calculated from appropriate data with standard analytical packages and then applied broadly in many contexts. Network analyses can be learned, or collaborations established. The crucial advance is to conceive of organisms as interconnected systems functioning in complex environments, in which mechanistic pathways hold only partial sway over eventual outcomes and multiple pathways may lead to multiple different outcomes depending on internal and external context, with no one-to-one correspondence that can be elucidated via more mechanistic approaches.

In more classical research, therapeutic trials to improve cognitive or physical healthspan via strategies targeting a single pathophysiological factor have shown limited progress. The urgent need for such advances underlines the necessity of complementary, systems-based approaches. For example, the limited efficacy of beta-amyloid targeting drugs in Alzheimer’s disease, still half or less of the minimal clinically relevant outcome differences, together with the well-established complexity of normal brain function, showcases the need for systems thinking in understanding and targeting aging-related health problems (28). However, this case also paradoxically warns for the multitude and gravity of potential adverse effects already appearing when only a single factor in this complex system of highly connected mechanisms is addressed (29). Therefore, it is both relevant and urgent to study biological aging from a systems perspective, to gain new horizons for improving healthspan, but also to safeguard the aging population against iatrogenic losses.

The additional systems perspective we present here may be understood as another boldly proclaimed need for a paradigm shift. However, this is not our intention. Paradigms are just models and theories to help understand reality. They never become reality and often do not make other paradigms superfluous. Several modern small-particle paradigms such as string theory exist together with the Newtonian paradigm in physics, where the latter still renders valuable models to explain real-world collisions and shapes education tools. Likewise, systems thinking should be considered as a practical, complementary paradigm for which validly, reliably, and reproducibly applicable methodological tools are available to integrate reductionist perspectives and data sets in aging research. We can also create a network of paradigms in aging research that can be applied as appropriate depending on the subject. As such, the paradigms based on the Hallmarks of Aging, the evolutionary disposable soma theory, precision medicine, personalized medicine, and the systems thinking of complexity science can together strengthen gerontological research, teaching, and inspiring geriatric health services. Sometimes already available clinical or epidemiological datasets can be used in systems research; sometimes specific data should be acquired (eg, time series of outcomes) or new types of data can be generated (eg, simulation data from computational systems-based modeling). This all opens up exciting new research opportunities, but also—especially at this initial phase—requires humility, scientific rigor, and transparency in our research practice.



[Noblesse Oblige]
In this context, the status of systems thinking as a reasonably new paradigm in gerontology requires prudence during application in research practice. This was also a criterion in selecting the papers in this special issue. Prudence should be demonstrated in a careful and understandable introduction of the methods used. By definition, complexity science methods connect different subdisciplines, and therefore extra effort is required to explain methods, statistics, and results for colleagues outside one’s own research niche so that these are readable, understandable, and—most importantly—repeatable. Abbreviations and jargon should be prevented even more than usual. Two complementary methods sections might be helpful: a first short section describing the methods essentials in lay terms, and a second (appended) section giving the full details, understandable and repeatable outside one’s own research group. Readability and replication for the interdisciplinary gerontological research community will be as necessary as proofs of principle for wider application of systems thinking. The latter are already present partly in the papers presented here, but still require fruitful translation in intervention studies. This may come when the base of application is strong enough, as was shown, for example, already by the application of systems thinking in enforcing electricity supply grids, in improving biological diversity in systems-based ecological projects, and improving the reactions of financial markets to the coronavirus disease 2019 disruption (30).

To conclude, we think that embracing systems thinking in biological and medical gerontology will be of great added value in studying many gerontological research questions, though this will not dissolve the huge differences in perspectives on aging, shown even among the most advanced scholars in the field (31). However, we do think and hope that by adding the systems perspective and applying its methods, both these differing perspectives and variety of scientists and disciplines involved become more synergistically connected in studying the big questions in this era of global aging. And, of course, we hope that you enjoy reading this special issue, and start considering how these principles and methods may be applied in your own research system.

TITLE: Aging as Adaptation

ABSTRACT: In traditional gerontological terms, adaptation is usually understood as the production of physical aids to mitigate the impairment effects caused by age-related disabilities, or as those alterations organizations need to make under the concept of reasonable adjustment to prevent age discrimination (in the UK, e.g., age has been a protected characteristic under the Equality Act since 2010). This article will be the first to examine aging in relation to theories of adaptation within cultural studies and the humanities. It is thus an interdisciplinary intervention within the field of cultural gerontology and cultural theories of adaptation. Adaptation studies in cultural studies and the humanities have moved away from fidelity criticism (the issue of how faithful an adaptation is to its original) toward thinking of adaptation as a creative, improvisational space. We ask if theories of adaptation as understood within cultural studies and the humanities can help us develop a more productive and creative way of conceptualizing the aging process, which reframes aging in terms of transformational and collaborative adaptation. Moreover, for women in particular, this process of adaptation involves engagement with ideas of women's experience that encompass an adaptive, intergenerational understanding of feminism. Our article draws on interviews with the producer and scriptwriter of the Representage theater group's play My Turn Now. The script for the play is adapted from a 1993 coauthored book written by a group of 6 women who were then in their 60s and 70s, who founded a networking group for older women.

FULL TEXT:

[Rethinking Adaptation]
The familiar layperson’s definition of adaptation is captured by the second of the Oxford English Dictionary’s seven different definitions of adaptation: “The action or process of adapting one thing to fit with another, esp. a new or changed environment.” Within gerontology, adaptation has usually been understood in “common-sense” or biological terms. Nikitin and Freund, for example, encompass both definitions:

A simple search for the term adaptation using the search facility on the landing page of The Gerontologist produced 3,462 results. Ordering by relevance (where the term appeared in the article title) demonstrated that adaptation was being understood predominantly in the same common-sense or biological terms. However, there were also a number of uses of the term as it is understood within occupational therapy, where, for example, “Occupational Adaptation (OA) is a theoretical framework used to facilitate people resolving real-world challenges through active problem-solving, using relative mastery as its measure” (McKay et al., 2021). Searching for the term adaptations (plural) produced articles focusing on technological advances and how these might be used by the geriatric population (e.g., Foster et al., 2016).

Within the arts and humanities, however, adaptation studies have now become an established field of study, with two international peer-reviewed journals. Adaptation, published by Oxford University Press, is linked to a professional association (the Association of Adaptation Studies) and organizes an annual conference, and the Journal of Adaptation in Film and Performance is published by Intellect Books. The websites for both journals give a sense of the richness and diversity of the field and also of how the term adaptation is understood. The Journal of Adaptation in Film and Performance focuses on “theater, film, and other media” and “the place of adaptation and translation within historical and contemporary cultures.” Adaptation includes interdisciplinary approaches from “Film and Screen Studies, Literary Criticism, Visual and Performing Arts, and New Media and Transmedia Storytelling. Topics range from familiar examples of adaptation such as novel and stage to screen adaptations to less recognised forms like remakes, fan fiction, and themed experiences. The journal encourages research that provides global perspectives on adaptation.”

One of the important early debates in the field was about fidelity (to the source text). Recently, there has been a definite move away from fidelity criticism (the issue of how faithful an adaptation is to its original) toward thinking of adaptation as a creative, improvisational space. As Linda Hutcheon puts it:

Hutcheon calls the discourse of fidelity “morally loaded” and “based on the implied assumption that adapters aim simply to reproduce the adapted text” (p. 7); in fact, adaptation may include the “urge to consume and erase the memory of the adapted text or to call it into question” rather than to “pay tribute by copying” (p. 7). In practice, adaptations exist in relationship to the adapted text; therefore, they are inevitably double. However, questions of fidelity are not the only questions that can be asked about adaptations. If we move beyond issues of fidelity, then what should we consider in their place? Hutcheon argues that “the act of adaptation always involves both (re-)interpretation and then (re-)creation” (p. 8); this is sometimes referred to as “reappropriation.”

Julie Sanders points out the need to view the process of adaptation as collaborative: “adaptation and appropriation, as both procedure and process, are celebratory of the cooperative and collaborative model of creativity” (2016, p. 15). Like Hutcheon, she argues that concepts of in/fidelity are unhelpful, claiming instead that we need to move “towards more malleable and productive concepts of creativity” (p. 18). Rather than endlessly alluding to classical, canonical source texts in a respectful process, “adaptation can be oppositional, even subversive. There are as many opportunities for divergence as adherence, for assault as well as homage” (p. 19). One of the problems with common-sense assumptions about the relationship between an original text and its adaptation is the dominance of a language of accuracy, and the primacy of the source text, so that “the discussion will therefore always be couched in terms of difference, lack or loss” (p. 22). In fact, it is impossible to assess the extent or otherwise of fidelity, both because of changes in medium (in the case of novel to film, for example) but also because the original text is multiple, shifting, and complex. As Sanders has it: “many of the so-called ‘original’ texts we are handling […] are highly labile, adaptive patchworks themselves” (p. 27).

However, Geraghty argues that the issue of fidelity cannot be dismissed, because it “matters to the viewer” (Geraghty, 2008, p. 3). In her 2015 defense of fidelity, Hermansson acknowledges this point, and claims that fidelity criticism should be understood as “one essential tool in the intertextual toolbox of adaptation studies” (2015, p. 147). She argues for the importance of “opening out the study of the fidelity relationship simultaneously with consideration of other intertexts in the web (or layers in the palimpsest)” (pp. 156– 157). Adaptation studies, then, now focus on adaptation as a creative, collaborative process in which improvisational, even irreverent appropriation of the source text might take place, but in which the relationship with the source text is still worthy of discussion.

Theater offers precisely such a space or process for creative appropriation. Although in the case of scripted theater, the script provides a set of constraints that each performance follows, there is considerable scope for variance, or adaptation, from performance to performance. Sanders argues that “performance is itself an inherently adaptive art; we might even argue that each individual performance is an adaptation […] drama embodies within its own conventions an invitation to reinvention” (p. 60). Connor has written previously about her own experience, as a practitioner, of adapting, devising, and coproducing Strindberg’s A Dream Play (1901) for a contemporary audience in a café in the center of Manchester. She concluded that there is freedom in innovation and in the “transformative spaces that allow for multiple authorship, for creativity and play” (2018, p. 81).

This creative freedom can help create alternative accounts of aging in theater. Previously published work on theater in The Gerontologist focuses on older people’s theater-going and its value to well-being (Meeks et al., 2018) and theater arts initiatives in residential care (Pauluth-Penner, 2016). There is less work on older people’s participation in theater making (one important exception is the work of Lipscomb (2015, 2016a)). However, theater making allows for the generation of new conceptions of aging.

Lipscomb and Marshall introduce the concept of age “as a performative” (emphasis original; 2020, p. 1), arguing that “each of us performs the actions associated with a chronological age minute by minute, and that the repetition of these performances creates a so-called reality of age both for the subject and for those who interact with the subject” (p. 2). Lipscomb (2016b) also discusses the prominence of intergenerational relations and understanding in senior theater groups and their productions (pp. 179–180). Mangan’s (2013) analysis of the Western dramatic canon and contemporary British theater unearths how plays and performances are capable of both reinforcing and resisting familiar age ideologies, particularly the decline narrative. Davis Basting (1998) focuses on how eight different theatrical performances from the mid-west of the United States value old age as an important stage of life “that links generations, that is engaged in both the present and the past, and that is constantly changing” (p. 2). There have also been attempts to develop new, positive representations of aging by enhancing the visibility of older women on stage (Casado-Gual & Schevchenko-Hotsuliak, 2021), and exciting interpretations that foreground stronger pro-aging narratives while disrupting conventional chronologies of time and aging (see Henderson’s (2016) account of a Vancouver production of King Lear).

It is, however, the potential for the creativity and innovation between actors, audiences, and writers that can encourage awareness of and resistance to internalized ageist beliefs (Black & Lipscomb, 2017) to “expand the discourse about ageing” (Gatt, 2023). Casado-Gual (2021), for example, examines theater companies that work to connect local communities with artistic and academic institutions as sites where different meanings of age can be circulated and integrated. Casado-Gual concludes that such companies produce an affirmative discourse of aging that questions conventional binary (decline/success) narratives of aging. Similarly, Gillespie (2019) examines renowned company Split Britches’ production of Unexploded Ordnances. This production included audience interaction by the oldest members of the audience to create an interactive discussion about current crises to encourage thinking beyond finite endings. In this paper, we offer some insight into the practices of theatrical adaptation to help open up our critical and creative grasp of how alternative accounts of aging can be produced.



[Method]
In 2019, two interviews were conducted with the producer and scriptwriter of the play My Turn Now. The research project was approved by the University’s Ethics Committee. The interviews were unstructured, although they started with a prompt asking the interviewees why they were involved with the play and their creative process in creating the play. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by drawing upon Braun and Clarke’s (2006) step framework for thematic analysis. Familiarity with the data is a key aspect of Braun and Clarke’s approach to thematic analysis; accordingly, the transcript was read through several times while listening to the audio recording. We then worked through the transcript to produce initial codes. We used a manual method of highlighting the transcript, firstly independently so we could check coding reliability, and then as a team. The codes were herded into themes, which were reviewed and redefined in turn. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on an overarching theme we have labeled “aging as adaptation,” which incorporates subthemes of (i) adaptation and iteration, (ii) adaptation and collaboration, and (iii) adaptation and intergenerational feminism, which we take in turn below.

Perhaps the most interesting and innovative aspect of My Turn Now is the interaction between the front-of-stage and “backstage” characters in relation to the book. Their bleeding into one another generates a metatheatrical quality that makes the connections and comparisons between previous and current attitudes to gender and aging very clear. This innovation was necessitated by the book itself: its own unconventional form (“there isn’t really a narrative in the book”) meant that they “decided very early this is going to be an ‘inspired by’ rather than an ‘adaption of’ or a ‘based on’ even” (Producer). However, the main inspiration for the front/backstage arose from group readings and discussions of the book:

The “gold” refers to the opportunities for dialogue with the book and across several professional and personal experiences of age and aging as contemporary women related experiences from the past with their own. According to the producer, the work of improvising and then devising allowed the actors to incorporate

We have written elsewhere about the adverse impact of ageism on the careers of women actors, as gendered age stereotyping produces a striking reduction in the quantity and complexity of roles for women actors as they enter their 40s (Raisborough et al., 2021). The intersections of sexism and ageism may therefore be particularly pronounced for women actors, many of whom are forced out of the profession as roles dry up: with that loss goes the ability to earn a living (Nobis, 2015). The “personal” “painful stuff” suggests how much these connected forms of oppression become embodied and affectual for older women, particularly those who make a living from acting/embodying a different person. Clarke and Korotchenko, for example, argue that there is some evidence to support the idea that “the means by which older women evaluate their bodies shifts from appearance to physical function” (2011, p. 497). As women actors age, painful experiences of sexism and ageism are increasingly lived “on the body.”

Significantly for our purposes, the choice not to pursue a faithful adaptation, while allowing creative “gold” did nonetheless introduce two issues. The first was the play’s relationship to the original book and the second was the skill set required to create new narratives. In terms of the first, the producer explained that

Concepts of responsibility and fidelity here speak to the producer’s concern to air the various voices of the wider project: a creative tension developed from the need to represent the hens and to air the experiences of the contemporary women actors. As we discussed above, the nature of the original book (collaboratively written and with no clear narrative) combined with the dynamic discussions and improvising sessions during the first reading to open up new creative opportunities. The reworkings of the script through discussions and improvising possible scenarios for the stage enabled curious recharacterizations that blended the hens’ voices with those of the actors to create what the scriptwriter called “composite characters”:

It was through the development of composite characters (characters composed of more than one real life or fictional individual) and the process of devising (collaborative creation by the performers of a new piece of theater incorporating their life experience without a preexisting script) that once marginalized accounts of aging could be aired. Both interviewees were aware of the mainly middle-class, heterosexual Whiteness of the original hens. Both reflected on the lack of diversity in contemporary theater for women of color, sexuality, and class as they intersected with aging. It was this that motivated their political desire to create theater that rendered visible otherwise invisibilized power relations in order to generate transformation. The producer expressed this as a responsibility:

Here we see that freedom from fidelity allows the process of adaptation to become transformative. It is precisely this point that Sanders makes in her discussion of adaptations of Shakespeare, where “the transformation involved in seeing things from a different point of view is a driving force” (p. 61). The driving force of the adaptation process pulls on the reflexive positionings of the producer and scriptwriter, who are drawn to think critically about their ability to create diverse composite characters from their situated positions of race and age privilege. As a younger, White woman, the scriptwriter spoke of the need to create more diverse representations yet of the “ethical questions” this posed for her:

The scriptwriter here articulates a clear sense of the ways in which the processes of adaptation and collaboration drew on the different experience of the woman actor of color. Despite concerns about the ethics of a White person writing a person of color’s story, the scriptwriter’s doubts about this were overtaken by feeling a clear responsibility to include different and diverse stories and to include an awareness of the intersectional nature of forms of dis/privilege. Researching the stories of prominent women of color in the 1980s allowed the scriptwriter to offer a more nuanced understanding of this: the character is disprivileged in terms of race, but not in social status. Yet the decision to understand the play as “inspired” by the book allowed a stronger collaborative and affective bond between actors, producer, and scriptwriter as part of a shared creative encounter. And too a stronger political motivation to confront power relations in the cultural industries. The devising work of the actors, which drew on their own experiences of sexism and ageism in the theater and other cultural industries, was centered.

It is clear that the collaborative creation of Growing Old Disgracefully means that it was already, in Sanders’s terms, a “highly labile, or patchwork” text (p. 27) composed by multiple authors working together. The construction of the script for My Turn Now echoed that process, as it involved (as we have seen) the devising work of the actors, plus the work of the scriptwriter and producer. At one point, the team even returned to the original hens

This return was not, however, about authenticating the script in relation to the original source text. Although the three original hens have seen the play in performance, they were not asked for their feedback, as the producer felt that “it’s not that kind of relationship I don’t think that we want.” Collaborative working was not, then, a process of respectful homage offered by the younger women to their grandmothers’ original text but instead offered the opportunity for creative, improvisational, even disruptive work to take place in creating an adapted text.

The scriptwriter talked about the pleasures of collaborative work, commenting that “I also don’t love the isolation of the writing process and the huge pressure it puts on you as an individual, so I was really up for playing and doing something collaborative.” The idea of playing with writing and the adaptation process thus becomes a positive and rewarding alternative to individual authorship. Moreover, the lessons of collaborative work and understanding of adaptation as a collective rather than individual process were also connected to interviewees’ understanding and awareness of aging. The scriptwriter mentioned the “life course approach to thinking about aging. So instead of thinking about discrimination as you get old and old being a kind of ‘post-X’, thinking about actually how do we think about the expectations and prejudices we have about our age at any point in life.” Here, aging is something that everyone experiences, a part of everyone’s imaginary and actual narrative of self, rather than a point that an individual reaches “post” the age of “X.” This rethinks age as something that affects everyone collectively. Here the scriptwriter suggests a much more flexible, culturally and socially inflected understanding of age-based identity within the life course.

The life course approach to aging has been defined as a “negotiated, unstable assemblage of ideas and perceptions in which ‘age’ competes with other imperatives such as gender, class and ethnicity” (Hockey & James, 2003, p. 4) and in which, as Hockey and James argue, the key question is “how do we come to know that we are ageing?” (p. 3). For the scriptwriter, the aim of the project, then, was to create a collaborative, plural vision of the process of “coming to know that we are ageing”: “The ambition of this kind of project isn’t to replace that with another singular vision of what it is to be an aging woman, but to show the multiplicity of different ways. I mean there is an infinite number of different ways that we will age but to show more of that.” The scriptwriter here alludes to the need in the wider culture for an “infinity” of visions of aging. These are necessary not only to counter the damaging singular narratives that currently exist, but also to create collective engagement in and responsibility for those narratives. The collaborative adaptation process experienced by both scriptwriter and producer with the women actors and original hens generated an awareness of this need and how it might be met by sharing collective approaches to the process of aging among those of different generations.

The process of adapting their grandmothers’ book allowed both scriptwriter and producer to learn about the position of women decades earlier and compare it with their own:

A “second life” of “freedoms” for their grandmothers followed a confined and restricted early experience. This transformation was initially understood in relatively straightforward terms, perceiving those life alterations wrought by the aging process as the agent of change. The imaginative comparison between mother, daughter, and (implicitly) granddaughter focuses on the new opportunities for the mothers’ generation in comparison to the grandmothers’. The producer remarked: “The difference between the generation before them and the generation after them is just enormous. And these women all would have seen […] their daughters having freedoms that they couldn’t have imagined when they were teenagers or in their twenties or thirties.”

In 1999, Woodward wrote of the need for “generational consciousness of older women” (p. 163). Feminist scholarship and activism had been open to the criticism that aging was not an issue until the feminists of the 1960s and 1970s themselves grew old (Brennan, 2005; Rubenstein, 2001), even if it has since begun to address the topic in a substantial critical literature. Rather than wait for younger women to grow older and age into an awareness of the particular intersections of gender with age, the experience of adaptation involved in creating My Turn Now offers hope for what Purvis refers to as the “challenges” of intergenerational feminism (2004), in which a more critical stance on normalized power relations is created, along with the capacity to disrupt those relations with new accounts and vision of aging (Jones, 2022), It is important then, to explore how feminism can act as such as instigator of change if we think in intergenerational terms. Both interviewees demonstrated an understanding of this. The producer commented:

Seeing the hens’ growing awareness of their daughters’ increasing freedoms and the different world that they were able to enjoy was clearly a key impetus behind the play and its title. However, the relationship between the generations of women involved in this project was also important. The scriptwriter commented on her

There is a clear awareness of the relationship between her own position in comparison with that of her mother and grandmother. This also extends into reflections on feminism and its own historiography. Growing up in the late 1980s and 1990s, she remarked: “That’s not a bit of the history of feminism that gets talked about very much. That time period—the 1980s and 1990s—because in some ways as a young woman in that time it was quite a regressive phase, in that it was laddishness.” In relation to her awareness of feminism at that time, the scriptwriter was “brought up being told we had it all, you know, we’ve had first-wave second-wave feminism, so it’s [the late 1980s/early 1990s] this funny bit in the history of feminism.”

Growing up without a lived experience of feminism that felt real and directly applicable during the “funny bit” of the late 1980s/early 1990s was clearly a loss, but one that was only realized, confronted, and worked through later on, during the adaptive process of working on My Turn Now. The play itself and the process of creating it “help[ed] to make the different histories of feminism more visible.” She continued:

The words “reflected back” here are richly suggestive. The play can “reflect” on the period of the 1980s and 1990s and the present moment for the original “hens,” for those developing the play and for the audience. The reflective relationship works in more than one direction. In fact, the moment of the Hen Co-Op, Growing Old Disgracefully and the moment of the present-day do more than mirror one another: they exist in conversational dialogue, in an adaptive relationship that is about multiple different resonances and consonances between women’s understanding of feminism/s and also about women’s intergenerational experiences of aging.



[Discussion]
It is becoming axiomatic within age studies that current narratives about aging are damaging and restrictive and fail to generate the flexibility and creativity that is required of us all as we age. Even a feminist aging project explicitly focused on transformative visions of aging found it hard to create new visions of old age “if they did not connect to these widely-known existing ideas about what constitutes a good old age” (Jones, 2022). Jones continues however to argue that “research and other creative projects can endeavour to extend the range of what is imaginable” (no page). The process the Representage theater group went through when adapting Growing Old Disgracefully to create My Turn Now is an example of just such a project: it produces a transformative narrative for aging, but one that works to “reappropriate” (in Sanders’s terms) a source text, rather than seeking to create entirely new visions that are not rooted in a lived history.

There are many benefits to moving beyond fidelity to the source scripts of aging, even if those sources do still, as Geraghty suggests, “matter.” Rather than being constrained by previous fixed ideas about the aging process, it becomes possible to improvise, in a more playful way, new aging identities that are not solely based on what Sanders, in the context of adaptation studies, refers to as “difference, lack or loss” (p. 22). Understanding aging in terms of adaptation also stresses the importance of collaborative creation, rather than individual authorship. Sanders claims that “adaptation and appropriation, as both procedure and process, are celebratory of the cooperative and collaborative model of creativity” (2016, p. 15). The play My Turn Now exists in the form it does because of the collaboration of the scriptwriter and producer with the original hens, as well as with the actors who took on the roles and brought their own stories into the mix during the devising process. This collaborative understanding of the artistic process can, we suggest, be extended out to our understanding of the aging self, or subject. As we age, we draw on the experiences and stories of those around us. This is a continuous, iterative, negotiated, and transformational process; it moves beyond any necessity to preserve absolute fidelity to our youthful selves, while it acknowledges that previous versions of the self “matter.” It can offer a nuanced, lived practice of rewriting and change that is able to accept contingency.

Understanding aging in terms of adaptation also offers a positive alternative to the stress on maintaining independence as we age, meaning that dependence is then no longer viewed negatively. Instead, dependence becomes germane to the formation of any lived identity in the world. Segal argues, for example, that dependence is key to the construction of all identities, rather than solely to aged identity. She admits that fears about dependency are central, in her experience, to ideas about old age, but makes the claim that “differing modes of dependence are essential to the human condition” (p. 35). The scriptwriter of My Turn Now talked about the pressure the isolation of the usual solitary writing process placed on her as an individual. A similar pressure can be seen in the idea of maintaining independence as we age. Independence is the implicit necessity behind ideas about “healthy” aging; moreover, independence individualizes the aging process, with blame and culpability attached to the idea of dependence. The scriptwriter found a positive alternative to the usual writing practice in collaborative writing, which she termed “playing.” Understanding adaptation as a playful, collaborative artistic practice allows us to reconceive of aging in the same way: as a shared process that we are all continually experiencing, a process that should highlight the positive ethical aspects of dependence on others.

Reconceiving of aging as a process or practice of adaptation also recognizes the importance of intergenerational experience and promotes an intergenerational understanding of feminism for women as they age. The scriptwriter talked about “knowing through Grandma,” but also about not hearing about her own experience in official feminist narratives. She wanted to make “more visible” the “different histories of feminism” and felt that the play achieved that, particularly in the opportunity that the adaptation process offered to include the experiences of women of color and contest the White, middle-class voices of the original hens. The scriptwriter felt that the aging process demands a reengagement with feminism: on reaching her early 40s she wanted to understand where she fitted in and how to place herself, but also her grandmother and mother, within the “story” of feminism. It was particularly important for her to be able to reflect on and position her experience growing up in the late 1980s and early 1990s, what she referred to as the “funny bit” in the history of feminism. Purvis claims that generational differences can function to “proliferate animosity and divisiveness among feminists” and obscure what are actually political, rather than age-based differences (p. 106). She argues for the need to move beyond linear chronology. Many older women writing about aging have written about the new apprehensions of time that growing older brings. Lively, for example, reflects on the “new and disturbing relationship with time” that aging provides (2013, p. 43). The work of adapting Growing Old Disgracefully into My Turn Now meant that the women involved reached an awareness of the intersections of gender, age, and other power structures earlier than they otherwise might have done. It also meant that they saw through simple narratives about feminism that rely on linear chronology, whether that be in terms of waves or generations.



[Conclusion]
Our analysis of interviews with the scriptwriter and producer of My Turn Now makes clear the importance of reconceptualizing narratives of aging in terms of contemporary cultural theories of adaptation. Adaptation has the potential to provide a much-needed new resource, given that aging is usually viewed in terms of decline or “healthy aging,” narratives that both privilege independence and deny and “other” infirmity and dependence. Adaptation as conventionally understood within gerontology reinforces those ideas, as our earlier discussion made clear. Drawing on theories of adaptation as understood within the arts and humanities and cultural studies allows us to begin to rethink experiences of aging. Adaptation in these disciplines stresses collaborative creation (of art) rather than individual authorship. This collaborative understanding of the artistic process can also be extended out to understand the aging self, or subject. A collaborative, cooperative construction of the aging self also offers a positive alternative to a focus on independence, Our case study shows that the practice of adaptation has the potential to reframe dependence as germane to the ethical formation of a lived identity in the world. Intergenerational experience becomes part of such a collaborative construction of self and for women it is an emerging way of engaging with the different “stories” provided by feminism. Looking forward and back across different generations of women allows consideration of both continuity as well as issues of difference (particularly in relation to race and sexuality, for example) to be addressed more openly. Understanding aging in terms of adaptation allows for a lived practice of negotiation, collaboration, creativity, dialogue, and contestation for the aging subject.

The producer offered a craft metaphor to sum all this up:

The craft metaphor is a familiar one within feminist theory and practice (Harrison & Ogden, 2020); like a tapestry, an adaptation consists of many elements in conversation. Here, we offer it as an alternative to more familiar ideas about aging that have bedeviled the lived experience of getting older.

TITLE: Early ovarian ageing: a hypothesis: What is early ovarian ageing?

ABSTRACT: A concept of early ovarian ageing has been advanced. This theory suggests that some women will experience problems of fecundity at an early age given that the age of menopause is earlier for some women, and there is a fixed time of accelerated atresia leading up to menopause. Various components of this theory are examined based on existing literature. While the theory has merit, and is important to consider in terms of reproductive health, it remains a hypothesis. It is also plausible to consider that a segment of the population will have later ovarian ageing in that menopause can be as late as 58 years for some women. Further, it is not known whether there really is a fixed time of accelerated atresia leading up to menopause in all women. The practical considerations dealing with this hypothetical concern also are not trivial. How will certain women with early ovarian ageing be identified, what hormonal and other factors should be measured, and what advice is reasonable for these young women?

[INTRODUCTION]
The etiology of age-related facial changes has many layers. Multiple theories have been presented over the past 50–100 years with an evolution of understanding regarding facial changes related to skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone.1–10 Historically, facial dystrophic changes were attributed to gravity on the soft tissues over time and the descent of the facial bony scaffolding.11–14 Gonzalez-Ulloa and Flores15 presented their theory on facial aging and “senility of the face” almost 50 years ago. They first described facial aging in relation to changes of the skin, descent of the soft tissues, attrition of the facial septa, and craniofacial resorption based on observation. Plastic surgeons have searched to uncover the true myths behind facial aging in their quest to restore attractive, youthful facial characteristics in their patients. External environmental factors such as body mass index, hormones, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and unprotected sun exposure have all been associated with contributing to an accelerated appearance of facial aging.1 Pessa and Rohrich et al6,15–26 have spent 3 decades in evaluating and studying the anatomical facial changes that occur in the facial skeleton and overlying soft tissues over time. Earlier dogma of facial aging has only been recently supplanted after careful adiographical and scientific evidence of the tangible changes to facial skeleton, soft tissue, and skin and the three-dimensionality of facial changes with time. This special topic will provide an overview of the current literature and evidence and theories of facial changes of the skeleton, soft tissues, and skin over time.



[FACIAL SKELETON]
Original theories behind facial aging have focused on soft-tissue laxity, ptosis, and descent of the envelope over time on account of gravity. Anatomical observational studies evaluating skeletal morphological changes of the midface, mandible, and orbit over time by authors such as Hellman, Lambros et al, Pessa et al, and Shaw and Langstein et al confirm bony facial remodeling over the course of one’s life.7,20,25,27,28 Hellman7 identified that facial shape continued to change throughout life and outlined morphological differentiation of the facial skeleton. Three-dimensional stereolithography and facial computer topographic scanning provided radiological evidence of the facial remodeling in young and old, looking at specific changes to the maxilla, mandible, pyriform, glabella, and orbits.20,21,25,28 Lambros and Pessa et al uncovered the clockwise rotation of the midface in relation to the cranial base in separate younger and older individuals (Fig. 1). These studies highlighted the characteristic changes in the aging facial skeleton, concentrating on the posterior displacement of the maxilla, lateral inferior shifting of the lateral and inferior orbital rim, creating a larger orbital aperture, and shrinking of the mandible in a vertical and a horizontal plane. Pessa et al23 further expanded on Hellman’s work confirming facial skeletal “differentiation” with time, showing an increase in mandibular size and shape over time and the sexual dimorphism in lower facial shape (Fig. 2). These skeletal changes create dramatic shifting of the overlying soft tissue and retaining ligaments of the face, and when combined with fat atrophy and volume loss, these provide a tangible explanation behind the complex, multifaceted etiology of facial aging. Obviously, limitations to these studies are use of different younger and older individuals in their comparison; however, their findings should not be dismissed. These landmark studies opened new doors in understanding the complexities of facial aging and the pivotal role of facial bony resorption and remodeling. Changes to the bony scaffolding with time inarguably lead to significant facial change and act in concert with soft-tissue atrophy and laxity, creating the appearance of aging.

A graduated level of understanding of these changes leads to the development of specific treatment modalities designed to address the bony attrition with techniques such as focused midface and chin implantation and subperiosteally placed calcium hydroxyapatite filler (ie, Radiesse).



[FACIAL SOFT TISSUE AND FAT COMPARTMENTS]
The recent description of the superficial and deep fat compartments of the face by Rohrich and Pessa20 and radiological confirmation by Gierloff et al29 not only reinforced the soft-tissue compartmentalization of the face but also provided further support of the theory of facial deflation and volume changes to these compartments over time (Figs. 3 and 4). Defined anatomical boundaries of the nasolabial, medial, middle, lateral superficial cheek, deep medial cheek, suborbicularis, buccal, and periorbital fat compartments provide evidence of the compartmentalization of the facial soft issues. Further, injection studies performed by Pessa, Rohrich, and Ristow et al highlighted the powerful topographical changes that occur with limited volumetric changes in these specific areas of the face (Figs. 5 and 6).26 Attenuation of the zygomatic-cutaneous, orbitomalar, and mandibular retaining ligaments of the face gives the appearance of descent of the facial soft tissue, and as anatomical studies have confirmed, it acts as a hammock to the atrophied fat compartments and soft tissues of the face, contributing to the morphological appearance of the tear trough deformity, malar bags, and jowling.5,6,11,12,17,29–33 The deflation and loss of the normal anatomic subcutaneous facial fat compartments gives off the appearance of increased skin laxity or prominent folds around the nasolabial region, periorbital region, and jowl.15–19,32–42 It was once thought that along with atrophy and changes of the facial fat over time, the mimetic musculature and periosteum of the face also underwent similar changes. However, using magnetic resonance imaging, Gosain et al26 found that although facial soft tissues underwent ptosis and subcutaneous hypertrophy in the deep cheek over time, the mimetic musculature was unchanged in volume and length.

The uncovering of fat compartmentalization of the face has revolutionized the approach to facial rejuvenation. Focused localized fat injection and/or soft-tissue filler into discrete compartments, such as the deep medial, and middle fat pads of the cheek, has a dramatic effect on facial volume and reshaping the soft tissues of the face into an anatomically more youthful position.15–18 Fat injection techniques in combination with the resuspension of the facial and neck soft tissues through rhytidectomy, release of the retaining ligaments, and/or superficial musculo-aponeurotic system and platysma repositioning address specific soft-tissue changes on an individualized basis. Increasing anatomical understanding of facial soft-tissue morphological changes over time allows for tailoring of the rejuvenation techniques to specific deficiencies uncovered with detailed facial analysis.



[FACIAL SKIN]
The skin is the envelope or canvas of the face, revealing the deflation and atrophic changes of the underlying bone and soft-tissue compartments as previously discussed. However, in addition, the skin also goes through intrinsic changes over time on account of external and internal factors.43,44 Some suggest that repetitive dynamic muscle contractions result in the appearance of superficial and deep rhytids over areas of habitual muscle contractions such as the orbicularis oculi and oris, risorius, frontalis, and corrugators on account of fascial partitioning and connections of the dermis and periosteum between the different facial muscle groups. Smoking and photodamage result in increased production of intracellular reactive oxidative intermediates and species and cause a multitude of facial skin changes resulting in epidermal thinning, solar elastosis, and dermal collagen disorganization, leading to characteristics consistent with aging skin (Fig. 7).1,43,45,46

Solar elastosis is the term used to describe the histologic appearance of the photoaged dermal extracellular matrix. This condition is characterized by an accumulation of amorphous, abnormal elastin material surrounding a decreased volume and disorganized array of wavy collagen fibrils.47–50 It is hypothesized that the abnormal elastin results from overproduction of normal elastin, which is subsequently degraded by the chronic inflammatory state.47 The other major components of extracellular matrix, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), tend to diminish with age, but they are ironically increased in photoaged skin.43–46,49–53

Ultra violet A (UVA) and ultra violet B (UVB) radiation causes direct and indirect damage to skin through absorption of the Ultra violet (UV) energy. The two most significant UV spectrum chromophores in skin are DNA and urocanic acid. Although UVA has been shown to directly induce DNA changes, its main route of cell damage is indirect, that is, through the creation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals.46–55 Several matrix metalloproteinases combine to degrade the collagen extracellular framework, leading to an increase in oxidative stresses contributing to the degradation of the surrounding collagen and increased elastin production. The epidermis undergoes characteristic histological changes with sun damage, leading to increased thickness, slower keratinocyte turnover, and decreased melanocyte counts. However, there are also regions of increased melanocyte concentration, with increased capacity for melanin production and deposition to keratinocytes, which present as solar lentigines.46,54–58

It is important to remember that UVB light is almost completely absorbed by the epidermis, and thus dermal photodamage is solely caused by UVA. In unprotected skin, there is an increase in all cells and extracellular matrix contents, elastin, and GAGs, and in fibroblast and Langerhans cells.48–51 UV radiation has also been shown to increase angiogenesis and likely accounts for the telangiectases seen in sun-exposed skin.

In contrast to the epidermis, the histologic picture of photoaged dermis on the cellular level is one of chronic inflammation. Fibroblast and Langerhans cells are decreased and surrounded by abundant inflammatory infiltrate. Fibroblasts are morphologically abnormal and produce less collagen due to impaired signaling (lessened response to transforming growth factor beta). Langerhans cells decrease in number and undergo functional and morphologic changes. Interestingly, other major components of extracellular matrix, glycoproteins and GAGs, tend to diminish with age, but they are increased in photoaged skin.44–59 However, the increased GAGs are not found in the papillary dermis as usual; instead they are deposited in the reticular dermis within the elastotic material and are not able to regulate dermal hydration, leading to dry and leathery-appearing skin.

There is unquestionably a powerful genetic component to facial skin aging, which in turn plays a significant role in overall skin appearance over time. This is likely the most powerful intrinsic factor of the appearance of skin aging.44–59

Of all topical treatment modalities and gimmicks for skin wrinkle improvement and rejuvenation, there is substantial level 1 evidence behind the success of tretinoin in the treatment of photoaged and damaged skin. Actions of tretinoin, which is the active form of retinol, include prevention of the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and oxidative stress, and stimulation of regeneration of the ever-important extracellular matrix. Retinoids also inhibit keratinocyte differentiation and stimulate epidermal hyperplasia with increased keratinocyte turnover (Fig. 8). The addition of retinoids with various resurfacing procedures has proven to be impressively beneficial in the improvement of mild-to-moderate facial rhytids.43,47–52,60–62



[CONCLUSIONS]
To adequately restore youthful facial characteristics, adequate understanding of facial morphological changes over time in its entirety is essential. Over the past 20–30 years, sound scientific data and tangible evidence have provided a foundation for understanding the changes to the facial skin, soft tissue, and bony scaffolding that have been theorized to contribute to facial aging. However, understanding of facial changes over time is still in its infancy, and facial changes can only truly be understood when comparing the changes of the facial components in a single individual at variable time points over the course of a life as first instituted almost a century ago with the Bolton-Brush longitudinal growth study at Case Western Reserve School of Dentistry.7,23 Obviously, the evaluation of radiographical and/or anatomical changes of the same person over time is quite difficult. However, the historical theories of facial aging being attributed to the descent of soft tissues have now not only been validated by sound anatomical and radiographical observational studies but also expanded on advancing our understanding of the complexities of overall facial morphological change with time.8–10 The recent uncovering of anatomical facial fat compartment anatomy has revolutionized the concept and approach of adding volume to specific deflated soft-tissue compartments, creating a more individualized youthful restoration to the face. The outstanding improvement in understanding has compartmentalized the treatment strategy to facial rejuvenation. Restoring youthful characteristics starts from the skeletal framework and builds progressively to the canvas of the face. With proper diagnosis and facial analysis, specific age-related changes can be addressed. By improving the skeletal proportions of the midface with calcium hydroxyapatite, or implants, or restoring proper position and volume of the soft tissues with fat grafting and manipulation of the superficial musculo-aponeurotic system and lid structures, or lastly through skin rejuvenation with tretinoin, botulinum injections, or resurfacing, youthful characteristics of the face can be restored in a stepwise organized fashion that is tailored to the specific changes in the individual.

Morphological changes to the facial skeletal framework, soft tissue, retaining ligaments, fat compartments, and skin envelope all contribute to facial aging in variable degrees depending on the intrinsic and extrinsic factors highlighted in this report. To provide our patients with the best possible rejuvenation strategy, appropriate diagnosis of the physiological changes of each of the elements of facial aging is imperative.

TITLE: Ageing and sociality: why, when and how does sociality change ageing patterns?

ABSTRACT: Individual lifespans vary tremendously between and also within species, but the proximate and ultimate causes of different ageing speeds are still not well understood. Sociality appears to be associated with the evolution of greater longevity and probably also with a larger plasticity of the shape and pace of ageing. For example, reproductives of several termites and ants reach lifespans that surpass those of their non-reproductive nestmates by one or two decades. In this issue, 15 papers explore the interrelations between sociality and individual longevity in both, group-living vertebrates and social insects. Here, we briefly give an overview of the contents of the various contributions, including theoretical and comparative studies, and we explore the similarities and dissimilarities in proximate mechanisms underlying ageing among taxa, with particular emphasis on nutrient-sensing pathways and, in insects, juvenile hormone. These studies point to an underestimated role of more downstream processes. We highlight the need for reliable transcriptomic markers of ageing and a comprehensive ageing theory of social animals, which includes the reproductive potential of workers, and considers the fact that social insect queens reach maturity only after a prolonged period of producing non-reproductive workers. This article is part of the theme issue 'Ageing and sociality: why, when and how does sociality change ageing patterns?'

TITLE: Training the ageing bodies: New knowledge paradigms and professional practices in elderly care

ABSTRACT: In the Scandinavian countries, reablement has become a principle permeating all parts of elderly care, hence potentially transforming care and care work. This article explores the advent of new knowledge paradigms and practices of physiotherapists and occupational therapists transforming reabling care in particular ways, leading to what we term a logic of training emerging in the field. These professional groups have obtained a dominant position as reablement specialists in Norway and Denmark, where our extensive fieldwork was performed as part of a 3-year research project. Taking inspiration from Annemarie Mol's concept of logic, we study how professional practices are organised and infused with specific values, meanings and ideals in situated contexts. We hence explore the logic of training, its abstracted image of the body and rational goal-oriented model for progress measurement and its ramifications when addressing ageing bodies in a complex field marked by the unpredictabilities of the social and lived bodies, administrative rules and temporalities and the quest for empowering and involving clients. The paper concludes by pointing at new contradictions arising when practicing reabling care and particularly points out the tensions arising in care relations, where ambitions on empowering and disciplining the client and the elderly body may collide.

TITLE: Epistemic uncertainty challenges aging clock reliability in predicting rejuvenation effects

ABSTRACT: Epigenetic aging clocks have been widely used to validate rejuvenation effects during cellular reprogramming. However, these predictions are unverifiable because the true biological age of reprogrammed cells remains unknown. We present an analytical framework to consider rejuvenation predictions from the uncertainty perspective. Our analysis reveals that the DNA methylation profiles across reprogramming are poorly represented in the aging data used to train clock models, thus introducing high epistemic uncertainty in age estimations. Moreover, predictions of different published clocks are inconsistent, with some even suggesting zero or negative rejuvenation. While not questioning the possibility of age reversal, we show that the high clock uncertainty challenges the reliability of rejuvenation effects observed during in vitro reprogramming before pluripotency and throughout embryogenesis. Conversely, our method reveals a significant age increase after in vivo reprogramming. We recommend including uncertainty estimation in future aging clock models to avoid the risk of misinterpreting the results of biological age prediction.

FULL TEXT:

[INTRODUCTION]
Reprogramming aged somatic cells into pluripotency or other progenitor states was consistently shown to ameliorate various aging‐associated features, either by applying different transcription factors (TFs) or by introducing small molecules to cells in vitro or in vivo (Browder et al., 2022; Chondronasiou et al., 2022; Gill et al., 2022; Olova et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2023). To quantify the effect of age reversal, researchers resort to various methods, including “epigenetic aging clock” models built from DNA methylation (DNAm) data with diverse machine learning (ML) approaches. These approaches are widely employed to compare the “biological age” of reprogrammed cells to that of control cells (Simpson et al., 2021) (Figure 1a,b). These clocks are easy to use and can assess aging from the organismal to the cellular levels, which is particularly valuable in experiments where the large‐scale parameters of organismal aging cannot be measured, such as in vitro cellular reprogramming. Notably, a similar approach has recently been used to demonstrate rejuvenation in the course of embryonic development (Kerepesi et al., 2021; Kerepesi & Gladyshev, 2023; Trapp et al., 2021).

The primary assumption of aging clocks is that the deviation ∆ of predicted age from the chronological age C represents an accelerated or decelerated aging, that is, an increase or decrease in the biological age B (Rutledge et al., 2022; Sluiskes et al., 2024). One can express it as B = C + ∆. Since biological age cannot be measured directly (i.e., it lacks a definitive “ground truth”), the epigenetic age estimated by the clocks is therefore considered a proxy measure of the biological age (Yousefi et al., 2022). Consequently, owing to the fact that DNAm patterns are strong indicators of past influences and future health outcomes, the epigenetic age is proposed to serve as a biomarker for measuring the effects of pro‐longevity interventions in clinical trials (Mitteldorf, 2019; Rutledge et al., 2022; Zhavoronkov et al., 2019).

However, before aging clocks could be integrated into clinical practice, these models should provide an estimate of uncertainty for their own predictions. Uncertainty manifests itself in three ways (Chua et al., 2023; Hüllermeier & Waegeman, 2021): (i) Model choice uncertainty, part of a broader category known as epistemic uncertainty, represents how well a proposed model (its architecture, parameters, metrics, etc.) reflects the actual underlying process (Figure 1c). (ii) Out‐of‐distribution (OOD) uncertainty, another type of epistemic uncertainty, emerges when the testing data are not represented in the training data distribution, leading to a high risk of model prediction failure (Figure 1d). (iii) Aleatoric uncertainty originates from data variations that cannot be reduced to zero by the model (e.g., when the same DNAm level corresponds to different ages) (Figure 1e).

Dataset shift (Quinonero‐Candela et al., 2008) term describes the case of OOD sampling where the testing population is under‐represented within the training distribution. Dataset shift can be decomposed into covariate shift (e.g., differently distributed DNAm values) and response shift (e.g., different age ranges). Notably, batch effect serves as a notorious example of dataset shift in the field of omics data analysis because it indicates differences in covariate or response distributions between sample groups.

From the clinical perspective, epistemic uncertainty must be estimated to make reliable conclusions about whether to trust a model or not (Chua et al., 2023). Specifically, epistemic uncertainty resulting from the dataset shift should be scrutinized, considering the prevalence of batch effects in biological data (Adamer et al., 2022; Zindler et al., 2020). However, most popular DNAm aging clocks fail to meet this criterion (Figure 1f) because they are typically built using algorithms from the penalized multivariate linear regression (MLR) family (Mei et al., 2023) (e.g., ElasticNet). Such algorithms do not yield information on any of the uncertainties, except for the error between chronological and predicted ages in the training data (e.g., mean or median absolute errors, MAE or MedAE).

In this work, we question the applicability of existing aging clock methodology for measuring rejuvenation by specifically examining prediction uncertainty (Figure 1). To achieve this, we reanalyze published data of putative rejuvenation, focusing on extreme cases of anticipated dataset shift, such as cellular reprogramming and embryonic development.

Because biological age measurements cannot be verified explicitly, we introduce four different indirect approaches to this problem: (i) Elucidating covariate shift in DNAm values between the datasets of aging and rejuvenation. (ii) Evaluating the agreement between different aging clocks in predicting rejuvenation. (iii) Exploring if rejuvenation datasets can be employed reciprocally to predict normal aging. (iv) Assessing whether an aging clock capable of estimating its own uncertainty (Figure 1g) would demonstrate a significant age reversal in putative rejuvenation experiments.

We propose a comprehensive framework for implementing these approaches. By leveraging this framework, we aim to elucidate the most critical limitations in applying aging clock models to rejuvenation studies, which should be solved in order to drive broader acceptance of these models within the longevity community.



[RESULTS - Covariate shift can lead to biologically meaningless predictions]
To introduce the concept of covariate shift in the field of aging clocks, we first explored a simple, low‐dimensional example. In particular, we used two parameters (biomarkers) to construct an elementary aging clock for predicting chronological age in humans: weight and height (Figure 2a; see Methods). These two biomarkers strongly correlate with age during the first 20 years of human life (World Health Organization et al., 2006), therefore they can legitimately be used for age prediction. We analyzed the data of body measurements for male humans ranging from 1 to 25 years old (an approximate end of body growth), including both healthy controls (World Health Organization et al., 2006) and individuals with the achondroplasia disorder (Hoover‐Fong et al., 2021; Hunter et al., 1996) typically characterized by a shorter length of arms and legs (Pauli, 2019).

Inspired by the common framework of aging clocks construction established in earlier works (Hannum et al., 2013; Hollingsworth et al., 1965; Horvath, 2013), we trained an MLR model using body measurements of a cohort of healthy individuals to predict their chronological age, which yielded a good performance on the training data (MAE = 2.3 years, R
2 = 0.84). For the achondroplasia cohort, these clocks predicted consistently lower ages (Figure 2b), which would be viewed as decelerated aging in the context of other aging clocks. However, this interpretation has no biological support because the average lifespan of people with achondroplasia is around 10 years shorter than that of control individuals due to early‐life mortality (Pauli, 2019). We assume that this underestimation of ages in the achondroplasia cohort is caused by a covariate shift in the analyzed data, leading to a huge OOD uncertainty, which is not taken into account by the model. Indeed, the distributions of covariates (weight and height) differs significantly between the training and the testing data (Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, p value <0.0003; Figure 2a). In general, any significant differences between the observed distributions in training and testing samples should caution us against the casual application of ML models.

Next, we expanded our analysis beyond this simplistic case to examine various DNAm datasets and to thoroughly investigate possible covariate shifts in the context of epigenetic aging clocks.



[RESULTS - Reprogramming and embryogenesis datasets exhibit significant covariate shifts relative to aging datasets]
Covariate shifts can arise from various intrinsic and technical factors, including differences in sampling sources and locations, tissue cell content, sample handling techniques, instrumental effects, etc. (Zindler et al., 2020). To estimate the extent of covariate shift in DNAm studies, we analyzed four representative scenarios in the order of increasing expected difference between the distributions of DNAm patterns: (i) One aging dataset split into two subsets; (ii) Two independent aging datasets; (iii) Aging vs. cellular reprogramming in vitro and in vivo; and (iv) Aging vs. early embryogenesis, for which epigenetic rejuvenation was also demonstrated (Kerepesi et al., 2021).

As our study was aimed at testing the analytical framework rather than at providing comprehensive coverage of dataset shift in all existing data of putative rejuvenation, we focused on several outstanding cases of reprogramming, where DNAm was profiled across as many time points as possible, and the datasets were published in open access (see Methods).

First, we examined a DNAm dataset of aging human skin by Roos et al. (2017) split randomly into the training and testing subsets. As anticipated, we detected no discernible covariate shift: the subsets are indistinguishable by the PCA (Figure 2c), DNAm value distributions of at least top‐4 age‐correlated CpGs from both subsets perfectly overlay each other (Figure 2d), and the KS test for distribution similarity further confirms the lack of covariate shift (Figure 2e).

Second, for two independent datasets of aging human skin (Roos et al., 2017; Vandiver et al., 2015), moderate covariate shift is evident from a similar analysis (Figure 2f,g), with the KS test indicating substantial differences in individual distributions (Figure 2h): 81% percent of sites were rejected by the test (meaning that these CpGs have different distributions). On the other hand, a joint analysis of two aging mouse liver datasets (Meer et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2018) displays minimal covariate shift (only 1% of CpGs are rejected) (Extended Data Figure 1d‐f).

Third, a comparison of the aging human skin dataset (Roos et al., 2017) with two datasets of in vitro human fibroblast reprogramming (Gill et al., 2022; Ohnuki et al., 2014) revealed strong covariate shifts: at the early stages, the fibroblasts appear to closely resemble aging skin samples in their principal component (PC) coordinates (Figure 2i; Extended Data Figure 1a), but, as the reprogramming progresses through the maturation phase, a notable departure from the aging skin samples can be observed (86% and 69% of CpGs are rejected, respectively; Figure 2j,k; Extended Data Figure 1b,c). Such sample behavior during in vitro reprogramming might suggest that the reprogrammed cells acquire some phenotype unobservable in vivo.

To shed more light on this hypothesis, we further compared a dataset of in vivo reprogramming in mouse liver (Chondronasiou et al., 2022) with merged liver samples from two datasets of mouse aging (Meer et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2018), as these two studies demonstrated no significant difference in the previous analysis. As a result, we detected a moderate covariate shift according to the PCA and the KS test (32% of CpGs were rejected, Extended Data Figure 1g‐i), which might imply that the in vivo conditions are better at preserving the normal phenotypic characteristics.

Fourth, to address the “ground zero” hypothesis of epigenetic rejuvenation during embryogenesis (Gladyshev, 2021), we compared mouse embryos (Auclair et al., 2014) with blood aging samples (Thompson et al., 2018), as both of these datasets were used previously to demonstrate this phenomenon (Kerepesi et al., 2021). The first stages of embryogenesis strongly diverge from the aging samples, while the later stages align closer to the aging cluster on PCA, suggesting a moderate covariate shift, which is further supported by the KS test (15% of CpGs were rejected, Extended Data Figure 1j‐l).

These results collectively suggest that the DNAm covariates can lead to significant shifts between datasets, thereby implicitly increasing the risk of clock prediction failure. Given these risks, we advocate for the routine checks of covariate shifts between datasets using the combination of PCA and KS test or other techniques reviewed elsewhere (Quinonero‐Candela et al., 2008) before applying aging clocks.



[RESULTS - Aging clocks are inconsistent in their predictions for reprogramming‐induced rejuvenation]
When choosing a specific ML model to construct an aging clock, a researcher inevitably introduces model uncertainty (Figure 3a). The choice of model family (e.g., Linear Regression) includes certain assumptions about how the true process of epigenetic aging, not accessible a priori, works. Therefore, by training different aging clocks on different data or using different ML model families, one can expect to obtain varying clock CpG subsets (Galkin et al., 2020) and poorly consistent predictions of normal aging (Liu et al., 2020).

To demonstrate a critical role of model uncertainty, we leveraged eight published aging clocks trained on different CpG sets and tissue types (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013; Horvath et al., 2018; Levine et al., 2018; McEwen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) and applied them to two in vitro reprogramming datasets (see Methods). As expected, all these clocks varied greatly in their predictions across the reprogramming timeline (Figure 3b, Extended Data Figure 2a). We further focused on the period of the first 3 weeks of reprogramming (from initiation to maturation), as the end of the third week (approximately, day 20) marks the loss of somatic identity and the increasing risk of teratoma formation (Olova et al., 2019), which is undesirable from the clinical standpoint. A comparison of differences between the ages estimated at the beginning and at the last available time point before the end of this period (that is, day 15 for Ohnuki et al. (2014) and day 17 for Gill et al. (2022) exhibits evident inconsistencies for both datasets, ranging from the Horvath multi‐tissue clock (Horvath, 2013) predicting age reversal by 40 years to the Hannum blood clock (Hannum et al., 2013) predicting age increase by 13 years (Figure 3c and Extended Data Figure 2a,b).

To test the hypothesis that these discrepancies might have arisen from the differences in training datasets rather than from the clock models themselves (most of which are based on ElasticNet regression), we trained different ML models on the same dataset of aging human skin (Roos et al., 2017) and discovered that their predictions of rejuvenation demonstrate a considerable instability as well (Figure 3d, Extended Data Figure 2c). Despite these inconsistencies, most models indicated epigenetic age reversal. Therefore, the clocks could potentially serve as qualitative (or binary) predictors of rejuvenation for the in vivo studies.

To explore this possibility, we estimated biological ages in the in vivo reprogramming dataset (Chondronasiou et al., 2022). For that, we developed new aging clocks by fitting a Lasso regression over the combined dataset of aging mouse liver (Meer et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2018) (see Methods) considering that the CpGs in these aging and reprogramming datasets poorly overlap with the existing clock models, thus impeding their use. Our Lasso clocks yielded quite robust performance (Figure 3e), but they failed to register significant rejuvenation in old mice treated with OSKM factors (at the 0.05 level of significance), compared to old control mice (Figure 3f). Notably, all models consistently predicted higher ages for all control liver samples, suggesting a response shift (Quinonero‐Candela et al., 2008) (i.e., PtrainY≠PtestY) between the training and testing datasets, which might result from the differences in DNAm patterns between the training and testing mouse strains (inbred C57BL/6 and transgenic i4F‐B, respectively).

Taken together, our findings highlight a considerable instability of predictions with regard to the choice of both the training dataset and the model family employed for prediction. This lack of agreement between the aging clocks could, supposedly, result from the covariate and the response shifts described previously in this study, as well as from the manifestation of model uncertainty, leading to the divergent rejuvenation dynamics.



[RESULTS - Reprogramming data cannot be used to predict normal aging]
We further examined the interchangeability of the aging and reprogramming datasets. When the regression models are trained, they need to satisfy a certain degree of correlation expressed, for example, as the R
2 score or mean absolute error (MAE). Supposedly, in an ideal case, when a clock predicts age with absolute accuracy (R
2 = 1.0, MAE = 0), the predicted ages can be used interchangeably with the true chronological ages (because they are equal) to train another model on the testing data, and to predict ages in the original training dataset with the same accuracy. In reality, this ideal case is never observed due to the technical and biological variations in the training and testing samples and sampling techniques, and due to model under‐ or overfitting. But we hypothesize that if these effects are small (i.e., if there is little epistemic uncertainty), then the reciprocal prediction of training data by the ages predicted for testing data should still be possible, albeit with some degree of error.

To evaluate this mutual interchangeability of datasets from the perspective of model training, we developed an Inverse Train‐Test Procedure (ITTP, see Methods) (Figure 4a,b). Considering the availability of ground truth measurements, we divided the ITTP use cases into two categories. In case 1, when comparing two aging datasets, the biological ages are available for the testing dataset Xte and Yte (Figure 4a) because they can be approximated by the chronological ages due to the fact that the chronological ages provide important information on the biological ones (Klemera & Doubal, 2006). According to the ITTP, we first train model 1 (e.g., a linear regression) on the training set Xtr and Ytr to predict the ages of testing samples Y^te, where the hat symbol  denotes predicted values. Second, model 2 is trained using the testing features Xte and the ages predicted by the model 1 Y^te. If the datasets are indeed interchangeable, similarly good performance metrics are expected for the predictions made by model 2 for the original training samples (Figure 4a).

In case 2, when leveraging an aging DNAm dataset { Xtr, Ytr} and a reprogramming dataset { Xrep}, we cannot approximate biological ages for the testing dataset (Figure 4b) because we do not expect the biological age of reprogrammed cells to stay approximately the same as their chronological age, as would be the case for a dataset of normal aging. As before, we train model 1 on the training data and predict the ages of reprogramming samples Y^rep. In this scenario, we cannot validate our predictions due to the lack of ground truth values of biological age for reprogrammed cells, so we can only assume that the predictions are correct and use them to train model 2. If, as a result, we observe good performance metrics between the model 2 predictions and the ages of the original training dataset, then we can still assume interchangeability, regardless of the intermediary predictions of model 1. On the other hand, if we obtain poor prediction accuracy for model 2, then we infer that these datasets are not interchangeable, and that such prediction failure was supposedly caused by a large epistemic uncertainty, presumably originated from a substantial dataset shift. In summary, the ITTP approach contributes to our multifaceted estimation of prediction uncertainty in aging and reprogramming.

We further applied this procedure to all pairs of datasets described previously (Figure 2 and Extended Data Figure 1) and used the Lasso regression model family as models 1 and 2 (see Methods). Models performed well for the aging human skin dataset (Roos et al., 2017) (Figure 4c,d), both when applying model 1 to predict testing data ages (Pearson's r = 0.934, MAE = 2.8 years) and when applying model 2 to predict ages of the original training data (Pearson's r = 0.831, MAE = 4.4 years) using Y^te instead of Yte to fit model 2. Therefore, we inferred that the training and the testing datasets are interchangeable and can be used reciprocally to predict each other, which is expected for a dataset split randomly into two parts. Similarly, we obtained good reciprocal predictions for the mouse blood samples subset (Thompson et al., 2018) (Extended Data Figure 3e).

In accordance with the already demonstrated evidence that the datasets of aging mouse liver (Meer et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2018) exhibit no significant covariate shift (Extended Data Figure 1d), we observed that they both pass the ITTP relatively well (Extended Data Figure 3b,c). A slightly lower accuracy of predicting Meer ages with clocks trained on Thompson data (Pearson's r = 0.737, MAE = 6.14 months) might be attributed to the presence of a number of outliers in the Meer dataset (Extended Data Figure 1d). At the second step, however, we obtained great performance metrics (Pearson's r = 0.975, MAE = 1.49 months), which is another evidence of absence of a significant covariate shift between these datasets.

Case 2 applications of the ITTP demonstrated more diverse results. Both in vitro fibroblast reprogramming datasets (Figure 4e and Extended Data Figure 3a) yielded poor predictions for the aging human skin data (Pearson's r = 0.235, MAE = 52.7 years and Pearson's r = 0.239, MAE = 34.3 years for the second‐step models trained on the Ohnuki et al. (2014) and the Gill et al. (2022) datasets, respectively). We therefore concluded that the reprogramming datasets cannot be used to predict normal aging skin data if we consider age predictions for the reprogramming data to be accurate.

The dataset of in vivo reprogramming in mouse liver (Chondronasiou et al., 2022), on the other hand, passed the second step of ITTP with remarkable success, demonstrating the performance metrics of Pearson's r = 0.968 and MAE = 2.21 months (Extended Data Figure 3d). Of note, the predictions at step 1 are shifted upward, while the aging trend is still captured well (Pearson's r = 0.826). Finally, applying the ITTP to the datasets of aging mouse blood (Thompson et al., 2018) and mouse embryogenesis (Auclair et al., 2014) resulted in prediction failures similar to that of in vitro reprogramming (Extended Data Figure 3f).

To summarize, the ITTP method highlights the concerns of applying aging clocks to the reprogramming data (or to any other OOD scenario). As an empirical test to discover possible dataset shift, it helps to assess the risk of prediction failure. The results presented above showed that normal aging cannot be predicted using in vitro reprogramming data, which immediately prompts to inquire whether, in return, the ages across reprogramming can be predicted correctly using data on normal aging.



[RESULTS - Uncertainty‐aware clocks reveal insignificance of age reversal]
In clinical practice, where decision‐making often relies on the level of uncertainty, an ML model is required to estimate not only the desired outcome, but also the uncertainty of its predictions (Chua et al., 2023). A robust model should be able to warn of extreme uncertainty when making predictions on shifted datasets. The majority of aging clock papers, inspired by Horvath (2013) and Hannum et al. (2013), have adopted the ElasticNet model that lacks inherent uncertainty estimation. To address this limitation, we turned to the Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR) model (Wang, 2023; Williams & Rasmussen, 2006), a variant of which was recently employed in aging clocks (Varshavsky et al., 2023) (see Methods).

To demonstrate the concept of GPR, we trained and tested it on a single CpG site (Figure 5a,b). A Gaussian process (GP) can be viewed as a probability distribution encompassing all possible functions that can be fitted over the training observations (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006). Therefore, for every input methylation value, a fitted GPR model provides an estimation of the most probable age, along with the probability distribution around this estimation with a finite variance that represents a credible interval for the prediction. The credible interval, grounded in Bayesian statistics, is calculated for each individual prediction relying on the training data and prior model assumptions. It should not be confused with a confidence interval which describes only the distribution of multiple predictions.

When a GPR fits the training data well, it computes a finite error stemming from the variation of age points associated with any given DNAm value (earlier referred to as aleatoric uncertainty). As methylation values move further away from the training distribution, the model assigns greater epistemic uncertainty. Consequently, the credible interval widens, reflecting that the model is less familiar with this particular range of DNAm values (Figure 5b). The GPR thus provides an estimation of total prediction uncertainty, encompassing both its aleatoric and epistemic components, and presenting it as a credible interval of several standard deviations for every individual prediction. Consequently, these credible intervals are employed to compute significance of difference between two prediction groups, such as control and treatment samples or samples from two different days of reprogramming, using a meta‐regression approach (see Methods). It is important to note that the GPR predictions are influenced by the choice of prior distributions over functions, meaning that the results may vary depending on these underlying assumptions.

In accordance with the previous sections, we employed GPR models trained on aging datasets to predict rejuvenation trajectories in the respective reprogramming scenarios and to determine the corresponding credible intervals (see Methods). When applied to the in vitro reprogramming dataset (Ohnuki et al., 2014), a skin‐trained GPR (Extended Data Figure 4a) predicted a noticeable epigenetic age decline from reprogramming day 11 through day 28 (Figure 5c), which aligned well with our previous observations obtained with ElasticNet (Figure 3a) and with the observations made by the authors of said dataset. However, the accompanying credible interval of two standard deviations revealed how extremely uncertain the model is about these predictions, especially in the case of the late reprogramming phase. This uncertainty prompts questions regarding the significance of any rejuvenation effect until the 20th day of reprogramming, a point at which a complete erasure of somatic identity was reported in the original study (Ohnuki et al., 2014).

Applying GPR to the in vitro fibroblast reprogramming dataset (Gill et al., 2022) yielded similar results, with two notable differences (Figure 5d). First, the credible interval at reprogramming day 0 is slightly narrower, suggesting that these samples might be more similar to the training set. Second, the model indicated a significant rejuvenation effect between days 0 and 17 (P value = 0.014), indicating that rejuvenation might indeed occur at the later stages of the maturation phase. However, the substantial credible interval at day 17 (spanning from 0 to approximately 70 years) restrains the extent to which confident statements on rejuvenation can be made.

We next revisited the in vivo mouse reprogramming dataset (Chondronasiou et al., 2022) using the GPR model trained on aging mouse liver (Extended Data Figure 4b) and observed a significant negative rejuvenation effect between the control and OSKM‐treated old mice (Figure 5e). This outcome highlights the importance of incorporating individual prediction uncertainties to resolve differences between groups that are otherwise undistinguishable by simpler methods such as Lasso regression. However, similar to Lasso‐based predictions, we observed a systematic bias in GPR estimations. This bias did not appear to strongly affect credible intervals, which might suggest that GPR underestimates credible intervals in cases of dataset shift, putatively resulting, in this instance, from the comparison of two different mouse strains.

The GPR model, trained on the mouse blood (Extended Data Figure 4c) and applied to predict the dynamics of epigenetic age during mouse embryogenesis (Auclair et al., 2014), displayed a local minimum at embryonic day 8.5 (Figure 5f), close to the putative ground zero event at E6.5/E7.5 suggested by Kerepesi et al. (2021). However, our GPR predictions are accompanied by large credible intervals, with insignificant age decline between days 3.5 and 8.5 (P value = 0.54) and subsequent insignificant age increase between days 8.5 and 10.5 (P value = 0.37). Consequently, this prevents the definitive designation of day 8.5 as the “ground zero” of epigenetic age. Notably, the credible intervals get narrower throughout the course of embryonic development, supporting our earlier observation of a larger shift between the early days of embryogenesis and the aging process (Extended Data Figure 1j).

Our findings indicate that a GPR model, capable of assessing its prediction uncertainty, can effectively detect covariate shifts in a test dataset by assigning elevated uncertainty to samples not represented in the training data.



[DISCUSSION]
Epigenetic clocks have been widely used to demonstrate age acceleration and deceleration in a variety of research contexts (Yousefi et al., 2022). However, there is still a reluctance to include clock measurements as endpoints in the clinical longevity intervention trials (Justice et al., 2018). In addition to the fact that the existing clocks fail to capture some aging‐associated conditions (Mei et al., 2023), we emphasize that they cannot be easily validated and relied upon, given their inability to estimate prediction uncertainty.

In this study, we present a computational framework for validating the rejuvenation effects predicted by the epigenetic aging clocks. Due to the unavailability of ground truth values for the biological age, the concept of epigenetic age reversal remains speculative because it cannot be validated directly. Therefore, we have to rely on indirect evidence. To address this challenge, our framework encompasses four specific approaches: covariate shift estimation, comparison of different clock models, the Inverse Train‐Test Procedure (ITTP), and the prediction uncertainty estimation using a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model.

All four approaches were used to explore clock behavior not only in aging, but also in the datasets of cellular reprogramming and embryonic development, because both processes are commonly viewed to be the examples of extensive epigenetic remodeling and putative organismal rejuvenation, as predicted by the clock models trained on aging samples (Kerepesi et al., 2021; Kerepesi & Gladyshev, 2023; Olova et al., 2019; Trapp et al., 2021). Notably, we did not treat these processes as equal, exploring each of them independently. The only claim we investigated was whether they can be reliably evaluated by clock models, regardless of any discrepancies that can be found between their biological mechanisms.

We demonstrate how the presence of covariate shift can distort model performance using a simple clock model trained and tested on the data of body measurements (weight and height) of individuals with and without achondroplasia. We then show that covariate shift is highly prominent in the DNAm data across cellular reprogramming and embryonic development. Moreover, by applying eight different published aging clocks (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013; Horvath et al., 2018; Levine et al., 2018; McEwen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) to the in vitro reprogramming data, we illustrate that the magnitude of rejuvenation effect achieved by the end of the maturation phase of reprogramming highly depends on the clock model type and the chosen training data. Across the discussed models, the age reversal effect can differ by up to two orders of magnitude, including null and even negative rejuvenation. Our ITTP approach further reveals that in vitro reprogramming datasets cannot robustly predict normal aging, thus additionally challenging the notion that normal aging can accurately predict reprogramming.

A GPR‐based aging clock can estimate the uncertainty of its own age predictions in the form of standard deviations, even for samples that do not belong to its training distribution. While reproducing the decrease in average epigenetic age, this clock demonstrates no statistically significant difference between the days 0 and 15 of in vitro reprogramming in one dataset (Ohnuki et al., 2014) (Figure 5c), and marginal significance between days 0 and 17 in another dataset (Gill et al., 2022) (Figure 5d). However, the accompanying credible interval at day 17 spans approximately 70 years, thereby preventing definitive conclusions regarding the observed rejuvenation effects.

The in vivo mouse liver reprogramming data (Chondronasiou et al., 2022) exhibits a covariate distribution closer to that of normal mouse aging. Moreover, it passes the ITTP test, suggesting that in vivo reprogramming might preserve organismal states better than the in vitro procedure. However, we show that both the Lasso and the GPR clock models surprisingly predict old reprogrammed samples to be either of the same age or even significantly older than the old controls (Figure 5e). This finding prompts further forays into the nature of processes accompanying in vivo reprogramming, especially in light of a recent study describing impaired liver function and premature death in mice with continued OSKM induction (Parras et al., 2023).

While testing the “ground zero” hypothesis of epigenetic aging (Gladyshev, 2021), we discover significant covariate shift and ITTP failure for the dataset spanning from early to middle embryonic development (Auclair et al., 2014). While average GPR‐predicted ages recapitulate previously described dynamics of epigenetic age decrease in embryogenesis (Kerepesi et al., 2021) and yield age zero at embryonic day 8.5, these dynamics are found to be statistically insignificant from the epistemic uncertainty standpoint (Figure 5f).

We hypothesize that the GPR model assigns such wide credible intervals to both in vitro reprogramming and embryogenesis because the totipotent and pluripotent states are too unfamiliar to a model trained purely on differentiated somatic cells. Thus, we have shown that an aging clock model that performs well within aging datasets will likely fail to reliably predict rejuvenation events not represented in the training data. To decrease this uncertainty, the inclusion of progenitor cells in the training dataset could prove beneficial. However, this hypothetical procedure requires thorough investigation, and it might still fail to aid in resolving reprogramming‐induced rejuvenation with existing clock models.

Our work should not be viewed as an attempt to prove or disprove the existence of rejuvenation effects, including the “ground zero” hypothesis of epigenetic aging. We also do not aim to comprehensively cover all available datasets of putative rejuvenation, be it reprogramming, embryogenesis, or other interventions. Instead, by concentrating on the most striking examples, we illustrate that the existing aging clocks that rely on overly optimistic assumptions (Sluiskes et al., 2024) cannot serve as reliable biomarkers of rejuvenation.

From the ML viewpoint, the effect of OOD samples on the prediction outcome is well‐known (Gawlikowski et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2021), as a trained model is highly unlikely to perform robustly on data out of the original distribution (Gawlikowski et al., 2023; Shvetsova et al., 2021). Likewise, the good performance on the training and the validation datasets cannot guarantee that the model trained to predict normal aging will reliably predict the rejuvenation effects. Nor could it be used as the reprogramming validation method, especially given the lack of ground truth and the large resulting uncertainty. Yet, these approaches appear to have become common today, which is one practice that we hope will be reconsidered.

When discussing the reliability of aging clocks, the question of their biological relevance inevitably arises. Recent discussions on the stochastic nature of methylation sites (Meyer & Schumacher, 2024; Tarkhov et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2024), as well as between aging clocks trained on purely stochastic or biologically relevant processes, while seemingly relevant, focus on the biological aspect rather than the purely statistical one addressed in our work. Thus, our framework does not distinguish between stochastic and deterministic CpGs, nor between clocks trained on stochastic versus biologically relevant processes. However, understanding the physical dynamics of DNAm would enable the development of advanced age estimation algorithms, including improved uncertainty models. This promising direction requires thorough future research.

Despite the clock drawbacks, a reliable surrogate health measure (Schork et al., 2022) is still required for the evaluation of longevity drugs and other interventions in clinical trials (Melton, 2023). Several criteria have been proposed for the potential biomarkers of aging (Moqri et al., 2023). We suggest that, in order to gain a wider acceptance within the longevity community, the single‐point age clock predictions must be accompanied by the uncertainty estimation (Chua et al., 2023), while acknowledging for the potential limitations of this estimation. Furthermore, we recommend assessing potential covariate shifts between datasets with methods discussed in this work before applying any aging clock models.

We advocate for the development of a clinically relevant and reliable aging clock with a clearly defined training target, such as mortality, combined with the ability to estimate prediction uncertainties. This approach is essential for alerting researchers to possible misinterpretations of the trial results. While such a protocol may add complexity to aging clock development, it is crucial for advancing the field and for positioning aging clocks as accurate health estimators.



[METHODS - Height and weight data processing]
For our toy example of the dataset shift, we sourced data from the WHO (World Health Organization, 2006) for the control cohort and from Hoover et al. (Hoover‐Fong et al., 2021) for the achondroplasia cohort. The datasets included height and weight means and standard deviations across various ages: 60–228 months for the control and 0–240 + months for the achondroplasia cohort. We interpolated the control dataset using the methodology by Andres et al. (Andres et al., 2015) to align age ranges (0–240+ months). Assuming a normal joint distribution for height and weight (Hunter et al., 1996), we sampled points with the corresponding means and covariance matrices. Age was uniformly sampled from 0 to 276 months. Thousand samples were generated for each cohort.

Using 1000 samples from the control cohort, we constructed a bivariate linear regression model with the Python scikit‐learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) package. Post‐training, this model was used for age prediction in the achondroplasia cohort.



[METHODS - DNAm data processing]
For in vitro reprogramming, we employed two datasets of DNAm profiling throughout the human fibroblast reprogramming timeline by Ohnuki et al. (2014) and Gill et al. (2022), which are the only existing open access DNAm datasets of this kind, and compared them with the aging human skin datasets by Roos et al. (2017) and Vandiver et al. (2015). To compare mouse DNAm profiles across aging, in vivo reprogramming, and embryogenesis using as wide genomic CpG coverage as currently possible, we focused on the methylation data obtained by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) (Li & Tollefsbol, 2021). Thus, we employed multi‐tissue datasets of mouse aging from Thompson et al. (2018) and Meer et al. (2018), the in vivo reprogramming data from Chondronasiou et al. (2022), and the mouse embryogenesis DNAm dataset by Auclair et al. (2014) which stands out as one of the few bulk‐tissue DNAm datasets featuring both early and middle embryonic stages.

For the studies of Roos et al. (2017) (GSE90124), Vandiver et al. (2015) (GSE51954), Ohnuki et al. (2014) (GSE54848), Gill et al. (2022) (GSE165179), Auclair et al. (2014) (GSE60334), and Chondronasiou et al. (2022) (GSE156557), files containing processed methylation beta values were downloaded from the GEO database under the corresponding accession numbers. For detailed description of sample groups isolated for our analysis, see Table S1. Methylation matrices were assembled for each dataset by merging selected samples and retaining only those CpGs that appeared in every sample of the respective dataset.

To showcase the absence of covariate shift within the same dataset, we split the dataset from Roos et al. into training and testing subsets. We used the train_test_split function from the Python scikit‐learn library, which ensures that the data is randomly divided into the specified proportions. Specifically, we fixed the random_state parameter for splitting reproducibility, set aside 50% of data for testing and used the remaining 50% for training. This method allows for a randomized and balanced division of the dataset, preventing any biases that might arise from manual or nonrandom splitting procedures.

A processed multi‐tissue RRBS dataset from the Thompson et al. study was downloaded from the GEO database, where it is deposited under accession no. GSE120132 (Thompson et al., 2018). As all other mouse DNAm studies referenced in this study used wild‐type C57Bl/6J or related mouse strains, we selected 196 samples representing this strain from the 549 samples comprising the original dataset. In the original dataset, CpG methylation values from both DNA strands were combined and assigned to the forward strand cytosines, while retaining strand annotation. To utilize as much information as possible, we treated methylation values from forward and backward strands separately. A processed multi‐tissue RRBS dataset from the Meer et al. study comprising 81 samples was also downloaded from the GEO database under accession no. GSE121141 (Meer et al., 2018).

For the studies of Thompson et al. and Meer et al., we followed the instructions on data processing provided by Trapp et al.: in each dataset, we retained only autosomal DNAm sites that featured at least 5‐fold coverage in no less than 90% of samples, which yielded 1,242,194 and 2,131,404 sites, respectively. For the analysis of embryonic development, we further isolated 50 blood samples from the Thompson et al. dataset. For the analysis of in vivo liver reprogramming, we isolated 30 and 20 liver samples from the Thompson et al. and the Meer et al. datasets, respectively, and merged them into one methylation matrix.



[METHODS - Principles of CpG selection]
CpG site selection for aging clock training is a nuanced challenge, with various authors suggesting distinct, minimally overlapping subsets (Galkin et al., 2020). To tackle this problem, we used CpGs from established clocks most relevant to each corresponding dataset pair, considering tissue composition of the respective datasets. For instance, in analyzing covariate shift between the aging human skin and in vitro human fibroblast reprogramming datasets, Horvath's skin clocks (Horvath et al., 2018) and the corresponding CpGs were employed. While any accurate age‐predicting CpG subset could suffice, we predominantly used known subsets for methodological simplicity where possible. The detailed description of dataset pairs, clock models, and the amount of clock sites observed in the datasets is specified in Table S2.



[METHODS - Principal component analysis (PCA) for covariate shift visualization]
PCA presented in Figure 2c,f,i and Extended Data Figure 1a,d,g,j was conducted on merged dataset pairs to select CpGs for the covariate shift analysis (refer to previous sections). This analysis employed the Python scikit‐learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) with the default parameters. The two‐dimensional kernel density estimations of PCA results were performed using the kdeplot function from the Python seaborn package.



[METHODS - Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for a shift of individual covariates]
We employed a two‐tailed Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test on the selected CpGs (refer to site selection principles above) to detect covariate shifts between the dataset pairs. This test assessed the null hypothesis that the beta value distributions for a specific CpG site are identical across a given dataset pair. We applied the Benjamini‐Hochberg correction to the computed p values, considering the adjusted p value below 0.01 as indicative of a significant distributional shift. The KS statistics and the p values were calculated using scipy (Virtanen et al., 2020), and the multiple testing correction was performed with statsmodels (Seabold & Perktold, 2010) in Python.

Importantly, the KS test can be sensitive to small sample sizes. With small datasets, the test may not have enough power to detect meaningful differences between distributions that may potentially lead to type II statistical error. This is why it is better to consider results of this test along with PCA projections to detect covariate shift. Another potential limitation of KS test is a sensitivity to outliers, given that the number of present outliers is high. We do not, however, expect the number of outliers in the compared datasets to be high compared to the sample size. Another possible limitation of using the KS test in the context of covariate shift detection arises when the training dataset is a generalization of the test dataset. In other words, the samples in the test dataset are represented in the training dataset, but not all samples in the training dataset are represented in the test dataset.



[METHODS - Testing in vitro reprogramming datasets with different published epigenetic aging clocks]
We evaluated the consistency of predictions across eight aging clock models using the R methylclock (Pelegí‐Sisó et al., 2021) package, which predicts epigenetic age from the input matrices of CpG methylation beta values. The clocks included: Horvath's multi‐tissue clock (Horvath, 2013), Hannum's blood clock (Hannum et al., 2013), Horvath's skin+blood clock (Horvath et al., 2018) (notated as Horvath skin in this paper), PedBE clock (McEwen et al., 2020), Wu's clock (Wu et al., 2019), Zhang's Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) and ElasticNet‐based (notated as Zhang in this paper) clocks (Zhang et al., 2019), and Levine's blood clock (also known as PhenoAge) (Levine et al., 2018). All methylclock‐generated predictions are available in our GitHub repository provided further below.



[METHODS - Testing in vitro reprogramming datasets with different models of aging clocks trained on the same dataset]
To evaluate prediction consistency across different aging clock model families, we employed five different ML models from the scikit‐learn package: k‐neighbors regressor (the KNeighborsRegressor function), random forest regressor (the RandomForestRegressor function), support vector regressor (the SVR function), Bayesian ridge regressor (the BayesianRidge function), and histogram‐based gradient boosting regressor (the HistGradientBoostingRegressor function). These models were trained on the aging human skin dataset (Roos et al., 2017) using 5‐fold cross‐validation and hyperparameter optimization via grid search, assessing model performance with the mean squared error metric. Performance metrics of the optimally‐tuned models for both the training and testing subsets are summarized in Table 1.



[METHODS - Lasso clocks for the in vivo reprogramming testing]
We observed that the in vivo reprogramming dataset (Chondronasiou et al., 2022) exhibited limited overlap with three established mouse aging clocks (7/582 sites in the Thompson clocks (Thompson et al., 2018), 3/90 sites in the Meer clocks (Meer et al., 2018), and 16/436 sites in the Petkovich clocks (Petkovich et al., 2017)), potentially impairing clock predictions. Consequently, we developed a new clock using a Lasso penalized regression model, trained on the liver samples combined from the Thompson et al. (Thompson et al., 2018) and Meer et al. (Meer et al., 2018) aging mouse liver datasets. Utilizing the LassoCV class from scikit‐learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), we identified the optimal regularization hyperparameter α through 5‐fold cross‐validation. The final model, selecting 22 out of 16,849 CpGs (Table S3), exhibited strong performance while testing (MAE = 2.2 months, R
2 = 0.866), as detailed in Figure 3e. This model was then applied to predict epigenetic age in the in vivo reprogramming dataset (Chondronasiou et al., 2022).



[METHODS - Inverse train‐test procedure with Lasso regression]
In general, the Inverse Train‐Test procedure (ITTP) can be applied to any pair of datasets to test their interchangeability. However, in practice, the outcome of the procedure will depend on the generalizing abilities of the chosen model. Thus, it is crucial to use models from the same family (for instance, linear models) at steps 1 and 2 of the ITTP. We decided to choose a linear regression model with Lasso penalization as a base model (i.e., model 1 and model 2 in Figure 4a) for the ITTP because it has generalization properties equivalent to ElasticNet (most often used aging clock model), but is easier to train (optimizing one hyperparameter instead of two). Below, we provide a detailed algorithm for the ITTP procedure for both use cases discussed in this study, presuming that the Lasso model is used as the base model.



[METHODS - Prediction uncertainty inference using GPR model]
A GPR model was developed to predict the age of samples given their methylome. GPR is a flexible nonparametric Bayesian approach to the regression tasks (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006). In our model, the inputs are the same CpGs used for covariate shift analysis from the published and the newly constructed (see the section about Lasso training) aging clocks (Table S2), and the outputs are the ages of the sample donors. The model was trained using the Python scikit‐learn package with a composite kernel comprising the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and the white noise kernels elaborated further below.

Given that the methodology we use to build the GPR‐based aging clocks has been described in detail elsewhere (Varshavsky et al., 2023), this section is focused primarily on deriving the prediction uncertainty, which is essential for our study. A Gaussian Process (GP) is a probability distribution over possible functions that fit a set of points. Formally, it is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006). Given a train sample set X = {x
1…, x

n
} ∈ Rd, a mean function m: Rd → R, and a covariance function k: Rd × Rd → R, a GP can be written as f(x) ∼ GP(m(x), k(x, x
')), if the outputs f = (f(x
1), f(x

n
))
T
 have a Gaussian distribution described by f ∼ N(μ, Σ), where μ = m(x
1…, x

n
) and Σ
i,j
 = k(x

i
, x

j
). The mean function is usually assumed to be the zero function, and the covariance function is a kernel function chosen based on assumptions about the function to be modeled. We tried different kernel functions and found that the sum of the Radial Basis Function and the white noise kernels performed the best in terms of prediction metrics (MAE and R
2). The RBF kernel was also used by the authors of the previously reported GPR‐based aging clock (Varshavsky et al., 2023). The RBF kernel is defined as:(1)kxixj=s2exp−xi−xj22l2,where s
2 is the variance hyperparameter and l is the length‐scale hyperparameter to control the smoothness of the modeled function, or the speed of its variation. Because GP assumes the output variable includes an additive Gaussian noise part ε ∼ N (0, σ
2), that is, y

i
 = f (x

i
) + ε, the vector of outputs is viewed as y ∼ N (0, Σ + σ
2
I). The term σ
2
I reflects the white noise kernel added to the model to account for the noise in observations, which corresponds to the aleatoric part of the prediction uncertainty.

Given a test point x*, its output distribution is defined as f*|x*, X, y which is a conditional Gaussian distribution of the following form:(2)f*∣x*,X,y∼Nμ*,σ*2=Nk*TΣ+σ2I−1y, kx*,x*−k*TΣ+σ2I−1k*where k* = (k (x
1, x*)…, k (x

n
, x*))
T
.

Thus, given the training data, the distribution of predictions of a new point is given by a closed analytical form of Gaussian distribution. In our model, the inputs are the CpG methylation vectors, and the outputs are the chronological ages. The mean of the distribution μ* can be used as the final prediction of the regression model (corresponds to the prediction of ElasticNet or other models). At the same time, the variance of the distribution (σ*)2 expresses the level of total prediction uncertainty—one of the most important aspects of our study. One can see that the magnitude of the uncertainty depends on the vector of covariates k
* of the new sample x
* with the training set samples X. Because the RBF kernel relies on the quadratic distance between the samples, the total prediction uncertainty for an OOD sample will increase as the sample moves away from the training distribution until it reaches the limiting value (σ*)2 ≈ k(x*, x*) = s
2, determining the upper bound of the prediction uncertainty the model can estimate for an OOD sample.

Although the chosen RBF kernel allows us to obtain the best performance metrics on the validation subset, it is worth noting that it also determines the nature and the rate of increase in uncertainty as the test point moves away from the training set. This is an important assumption of the model, which may lead to both an underestimation of uncertainty in the vicinity of the training dataset and an increase in uncertainty in a far distance from it.



[METHODS - Testing the rejuvenation effects using a meta‐regression approach]
The Gaussian process model, yielding uncertainty levels for individual sample predictions as Gaussian distribution variances, enables statistical comparison of two predictions via, for example, the z‐test (if two variances are assumed to be equal). For comparing prediction groups, each with unique variances, we employed advanced meta‐analysis techniques. Utilizing the meta_regression function from Python PyMARE 0.0.3 (Yarkoni et al., 2022), we accounted for individual age prediction variances in two in vitro reprogramming groups (e.g., days 0 and 15). This function, which incorporates average ages, variances, and a binary group indicator in the design matrix, uses a restricted maximum likelihood approach to optimize meta‐regression coefficients, providing coefficient estimates and their P values.



[METHODS - Computational and statistical analyses]
Except for the methylclock 0.7.8 predictions conducted via R 4.2, all other analyses were performed in Python 3.9.18 using numpy 1.22.4, pandas 1.5.1, scipy 1.7.2, and scikit‐learn 1.2.1 for data handling and the majority of calculations, and matplotlib 3.5.1 in combination with seaborn 0.11.2 for data visualization. Multiple testing corrections were performed with statsmodels 0.13.2 where indicated. Other packages and functions used for specific computational and statistical analyses are cited in the corresponding sections above.

TITLE: The Theory and Practice of Active Aging

ABSTRACT: "Active aging" connotes a radically nontraditional paradigm of aging which posits possible improvement in health despite increasing longevity. The new paradigm is based upon postponing functional declines more than mortality declines and compressing morbidity into a shorter period later in life. This paradigm (Compression of Morbidity) contrasts with the old, where increasing longevity inevitably leads to increasing morbidity. We have focused our research on controlled longitudinal studies of aging. The Runners and Community Controls study began at age 58 in 1984 and the Health Risk Cohorts study at age 70 in 1986. We noted that disability was postponed by 14 to 16 years in vigorous exercisers compared with controls and postponed by 10 years in low-risk cohorts compared with higher risk. Mortality was also postponed, but too few persons had died for valid comparison of mortality and morbidity. With the new data presented here, age at death at 30% mortality is postponed by 7 years in Runners and age at death at 50% (median) mortality by 3.3 years compared to controls. Postponement of disability is more than double that of mortality in both studies. These differences increase over time, occur in all subgroups, and persist after statistical adjustment.

FULL TEXT:

[1. Introduction]
“Active aging” and the related terms “healthy aging,” “successful aging,” “productive aging,” “aging well,” “living well,” “senior wellness,” and “compression of morbidity” endorse a radically nontraditional paradigm of human aging, which includes gains as well as losses and which posits possible improvement in future human health despite increasing longevity. Each of these terms, discussed briefly below, foresees a new paradigm for gerontology, based upon postponing functional declines into older ages with a goal of postponement of morbidity more than mortality, compressing morbidity into a shorter period later in life, and decreasing cumulative lifetime morbidity [1]. The new paradigm contrasts strikingly with the old “Failures of Success” paradigm, where improvements in longevity would inevitably lead to ever larger numbers of persons in ever poorer health [2].

There are differences in nuance between these terms and in the metrics by which they might be measured, and confusion might be reduced by greater agreement on terminology. We are most comfortable with “Compression of Morbidity” since it implies a strategy for improving health, the theory behind the strategy, and the means of testing progress, albeit a more technical term than alternatives. Of alternative terms, we prefer the term “healthy aging” since it includes the notion of improving each of physical health, mental health, and social health, whereas “active” seems more focused on the physical component of health, “productive” on some form of work product, “successful” on a quite narrow definition of aging, and “well” on the absence of disease. None of these terms are universally endorsed, but we need to recognize the common themes in these various restatements of the new paradigm.

Morbidity, in common usage, is a general term for the absence of health, and disability is the most frequently used metric for estimation of morbidity. Morbidity itself is an imprecise term often defined in different ways, usually denoting impaired health of some kind other than death. Morbidity itself does not have an agreed metric for its study. In practice, the most frequently used metric for estimation of morbidity has been ability at activities of daily living (ADL) as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index [3] or similar instruments [4]. Such instruments measure physical capacity and disability on a continuous scale and indirectly include the cognitive abilities which ultimately direct the physical activity and the social environment which enables it [5].

This paper attempts to pull together evolving theory and evolving practice, with an emphasis on the history of the compression paradigm and the presentation of new longitudinal data over a twenty-year period now confirming compression of morbidity by lifestyle choices under certain conditions.



[2. Theory]
Over thirty years ago when I first began to examine the postulates of gerontology and human aging I did so from a background in medicine, rheumatology, clinical epidemiology, health outcomes research, and health policy, with an emphasis on prevention and on outcomes of chronic illness [6]. From this perspective, it seemed clear that much diminished capacity could be postponed or even prevented at the individual level and thus potentially at the population level. It also seemed clear that overall national improvements in health would likely require reduction in health risks [7, 8]. Thus, the marked reduction in heart disease mortality beginning in the nineteen-sixties was associated with decreases in risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol levels. These clearly affected both age-specific incidence rates and mortality rates. Disease-associated morbidity from heart disease now developed later in life and mortality also was postponed. An evolving challenge was to develop risk factor models on a population basis rather than a disease-specific one, since allocation of disability and other outcomes to specific diseases is difficult and competing risks make apportionment inaccurate as well.

There is a clear dynamic between changes over time in morbidity and in mortality, since fatal and nonfatal outcomes are generally correlated. However, postponement of morbidity by itself would improve health, while postponement of mortality by itself would increase ill-health. The dynamic interaction of morbidity trends and mortality trends was critical to accurate prediction of future health. If mortality was delayed the most, cumulative lifetime morbidity would grow; if morbidity was postponed more than mortality, cumulative lifetime morbidity would be likely to decrease. The prevalent aging paradigm of 1980, however, implicitly maintained that morbidity would continue to develop at a specific age, but that mortality could be postponed to an ever later age. Some even postulated no upper limit to human lifespan [2, 9, 10].

In retrospect, the inadequacy of the old paradigm is evident. At the time it began to be questioned, however, there were few data on trends in morbidity and trends in onset of morbidity could not be reliably estimated. Trends in mortality rates over many years, on the other hand, were readily ascertainable, reasonably accurate, and these rates were declining quite consistently over time. Gerontology was colloquially referred to as “the science of drawing downwardly sloping lines.” The concept of the plasticity (modifiability) of aging, where markers of aging could sometimes improve instead of inevitably decline, was not often discussed. More complicated models were needed, where the dynamic relationship between morbidity and mortality rates could be understood. In turn, we needed longitudinal population data on morbidity. We needed to be able to track the results of risk factors on both morbidity and mortality. Only as data became available could hypotheses of Compression of Morbidity be tested.



[3. Science]
Scholarly studies of Compression of Morbidity took several forms, the most definitive have involved (1) longitudinal study of morbidity in populations with differing risk factors, (2) population studies establishing decreases in population disability over long time periods, and (3) randomized controlled trials of health risk reduction in senior populations which showed decreased morbidity.

Other productive areas of study [11–16], noted but not elaborated here for reasons of space, include associations of health risk factors, morbidity, and increased medical care costs [11, 12]. Moreover, supercentenarians, over age 105, have proved to have had less lifetime cumulative morbidity than those dying at age 85 or 100 [13]. Programs based upon “active aging” concepts, most importantly exercise, have generally been found effective although many such studies were small, short-term, and not well controlled [14–16]. On the other hand, we are not aware of long-term studies of exercise which were not associated with reduction in disability [17]. Internationally, some populations studied over time have not experienced postponement of morbidity and some may have increased it, suggesting that while it is clearly possible to postpone morbidity under some circumstances [16], this result is not an inevitable one.



[4. Longitudinal Studies of Disability: Runners Club versus Community Controls]
We began our two longitudinal studies of aging in 1984 and 1986 and results have been reported formally every few years [18–23]. These studies were designed to directly test the hypothesis of compression of morbidity by lifestyle choices. Here, we describe these studies informally, and readers wishing study details should refer to the referenced papers. In this paper, we present new data including mortality rate trends beyond the median age at death and analyze mortality data out to 24 years of study. We are now able to directly compare postponement of morbidity and mortality in the same cohorts, and postponement of disability is greater than that of mortality.

The “Runners Study” began in 1984 with recruitment of 538 senior runners and 423 age-matched (average age 58) controls. Runners were deliberately recruited from the “50 Plus Runner's Club,” for the most part jogged or ran over 2000 miles a year and were exercise enthusiasts. The control group was drawn randomly from the same community; about 25% of controls also ran recreationally, although they only averaged about 10% of the yearly distances logged by Runners Club members. Thus, the study allowed self-selection bias into the Runners cohort, conservatively included a very healthy control group. Analyses were focused in large part upon identifying, and if necessary adjusting for, selection biases [18–20].

The design was intended to achieve as great a difference as possible between groups in the independent variable of interest. In this case, we wanted a large difference between the exercise group and the controls in “vigorous exercise minutes per week.” We also wanted to create groups which were similar in educational attainment and income levels; lower levels of these socioeconomic factors are well known to be associated with poorer health and were potentially confounding variables for our study. Initial differences between groups in the exercise variable were tenfold, sufficient to dwarf possible confounders such as increased body mass index and cigarette smoking, which were rarely reported by either cases or controls. In analyses we also controlled for gender, ethnicity, physical injuries, family histories of arthritis, baseline X-rays for arthritis, chronic illnesses, whether they had ever run for exercise for a month or more, initial disability levels, and many other variables. Statistically adjusted data never differed significantly from raw data in any analyses. More complete discussion of these analytic issues may be found elsewhere [18–20].

Our primary analyses have been longitudinal study of the two original cohorts established in 1984. We also analyzed the “ever-runners” versus the “never-runners” cohorts formed in 1984 in order to exclude a bias where those who ran but stopped because of some physical difficulty and ended up in the control group; results were similar to those when we used the original runners and control cohorts but even more striking. Primary endpoints were between cohort differences on the horizontal axis over time rather than cross-sectional differences on the vertical axis (Figures 1–4). We sought to determine how long, if at all, disability was postponed in the Runners cohort compared with Controls [21].

Figure 1 shows disability levels [3] and 95% confidence limits from 1984 to 2005, comparing the Runners with the Controls. The Runners had slightly less disability at study onset in 1984, believed due to their prior 10 years (on average) of vigorous exercise. Over the years through an average age of 80, the differences in disability between the runners cohort and controls grew steadily greater and regression lines continued to diverge (P < 0.001). The postponement of minimal (0.1 units) disability was 14 years over controls, and postponement of a higher disability level of 0.2 units was 16 years [3]. In other analyses, runners reported substantially less bodily pain and utilized substantially fewer medical resources [22]. In an X-ray subset, runners had a nonstatistically significant trend (4 versus 12) toward fewer knee replacements and totally destroyed (bone-on-bone) knee joints [19].

These findings were robust to statistical adjustments. We believe that developing cohorts with a large difference in the independent variable, exercise, materially strengthened these results. It was similar in design to choosing to study lung cancer incidence in 4-pack-a-day smokers versus nonsmokers; the differences in lung cancer incidence would be very large and study would not require very many subjects to reach statistical significance. Of interest, about a third of runners in both cohorts discontinued running over the years. Reasons for discontinuation were generally social: the dog died, the subject moved to another climate, and running got boring. Essentially no one stopped running because of pain or arthritis. Almost all who stopped running continued other vigorous exercise through swimming, bicycling, brisk walking, or other activities. Thus, this is a study of regular vigorous activity rather than solely of long-distance running.



[5. Longitudinal Studies of Disability: Risk Factors of Inactivity, Obesity, and Smoking]
In the health risks cohorts (University of Pennsylvania) study, we have followed 1741 University of Pennsylvania attendees in 1939 and 1940 who were studied again in the College Alumni Study in 1962, and annually by our group beginning in 1986 at an average age of about 70 years. We formed three cohorts using data obtained in the College Alumni Study when they were in mid-life with an average of 43 years old. We did this to lock subjects into study cohorts with their mid-life health habits well before the media or the public knew much about these health risks, a conservative approach. Also conservative was to score only three health risks, arguably the most important ones, and to use simple sums of binary variables to define cohorts.

The risk factors were current smoking, body mass index (BMI) 25 or higher (overweight), and absence of vigorous physical activity (inactivity), including jogging, brisk walking, and other activities which resulted in a sweat, all as measured at age 43. The risk factor score was based upon low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (2 or 3 risk factors). Thus, the risk score used to define the three cohorts was a priori, arbitrary, and simple, and did not permit “data mining” of baseline scores of multiple variables to bias results. Some study power was probably lost through use of a simple index, but objectivity was increased and, as it turned out, there was plenty of statistical power. Study details may be found in previous reports [21–23].

The dependent variables were mortality and morbidity (disability), as measured in the Runners study, at yearly intervals. The plan here was to begin with cohorts about 10 years older than in the Runners study so as to study aging effects at higher ages, to use college classmates so that entry ages were clustered, and to select university alumni as a means to reduce confounding by poverty and other social disadvantage, as well as to maintain good follow-up rates and accurate reporting. Subjects were not aware of their membership in a particular cohort [23].

Figure 2 shows disability scores by age and by calendar year for the three cohorts from 1984 to 2005. The risk factor cohorts of low (0 risk factors), moderate, (1 risk factor), and high risk (2 or 3 risk factors) had initial scores in the postulated order, where the low risk cohort had less initial disability than the moderate risk cohort, which had less than the high risk cohort. Initial disability levels were all close to zero, however, and baseline effects were small. Disability levels and differences between cohorts increased monotonically over time. At last observation in 2005, high-risk subjects were about twice as disabled as low risk. Similar results obtained when we looked at cumulative disability, those living, those who had died, and men and women, and when we adjusted for covariates [23].

A disability score of 0.3 units (moderate disability) was postponed by 10 years in low-risk subjects compared with high risk. Since there were also differences in mortality, which was highest in high risk, noncompleters due to death were occurring particularly in the high-risk subjects with the very highest risks, acting against the primary findings. Attrition other than by death did not differ between cohorts. The relative contribution of each of the three risk factors was difficult to estimate because of autocorrelation of the risk factors [23].



[6. Longitudinal Studies of Mortality: Runners versus Controls]
In our study of runners and controls we have complete mortality data confirmed by the National Death Index from 1986 through 2009, a period of 25 years [18]. Two hundred and seven controls, out of 423 (48.9%) had died, compared with 164 out of 538 in the runners cohort (30.5%). Thus, we are able to compare differences between cohorts at the level where at least 30 percent had died in each cohort, but not at the median.

Figure 3 displays a life table comparison of the two cohorts. The runners had only 25% of the mortality rates of the control group over the first eight years, but there was subsequent convergence as subjects aged so that at year 25 the runners have 60 percent of the mortality rate of the Controls. Over the most recent five years the mortality curves are parallel or even closing slightly [18]. Median death for the controls is about 83 years of age; median age at death cannot yet be estimated for the exercising group but will be higher.

There are differences in the morbidity and mortality outcome variables in that mortality is binary with a metric of years to death, while morbidity (disability) is considered as a continuous variable scored from zero to three, usually with a monotonically upward trend in the individual once nonzero disability has been noted. It is difficult to estimate these outcomes validly until most subjects have died in all cohorts and one can compare median values. In Figure 3, the postponement of mortality is about 7 years in the runners at last observation, but this difference seems likely to close during the age period of 83 to 93 years by which time most of the subjects in each cohort will have died. Postponement of morbidity (Figure 1) is 14 to 16 years. Spousal validation studies did not reveal questionnaire or interview responses of morbidity of either runners or controls to be biased in either direction [18–23].



[7. Longitudinal Studies of Mortality: Health Risk Factors]
The low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (2 or 3 risk factors) cohorts had overall mortality of 60%, 65%, and 72%, respectively in 2009, so that all cohorts had passed the median death and all had at least reached the 60% mortality level.  Figure 4 shows Kaplan-Meier survival curves for these cohorts. Differences favoring the low-risk cohort tended to diverge increasingly from the high-risk cohort over the first 12 years and then to stabilize and to slightly converge subsequently.

Postponement of mortality is seen more clearly here than in the Runners study since a greater fraction of subjects have died. We estimate this difference by measuring the horizontal difference between the high- and the low-risk groups at each decile mortality line which meets or crosses all three curves (0.1–0.6). At last observation, mortality postponement is about 3.5 years, and it has been three to four years throughout. The median death occurred about 3.7 years later in the low-risk group as compared with the High risk [21, 23]. Using linear regression analyses to smooth the curves, postponement of death is 3.3 years in low risk versus high risk, with moderate risk always intermediate. This postponement was 2.5 years in men and 4.0 years in women.

Our estimates of postponement of disability in the two studies thus range from 10 to 16 years, and postponement of death ranges from 3.3 to 7 years. These results are specific to these risk factor distributions and these patient cohorts. The data, replicated by these parallel studies and backed by the general literature, suggest that exercise improves health, that nonsmoking is a healthy habit, and that a normal body weight is good for you, both in terms of mortality and also in terms of cumulative lifetime disability and other life quality measures. They suggest that postponement of disability absent these risk factors is several-fold the postponement of mortality and thus that the onset of disability draws closer to the age at death, compressing morbidity between a 10- to 16-year later onset and only a 3.3- to 7-year postponed age at death [21].

Contrasting the two studies, effects are similar for both mortality and morbidity, but the differences are less in the health risk cohorts than in the runners. These results suggest that lack of exercise may be the most important risk factor of them all, particularly in nonsmokers. However, the Runners study had a very large difference in the independent variable, vigorous physical exercise, by design. The risk factor cohorts were derived from a more homogeneous population with lesser differences in the prevalence of risk factors between cohorts.



[8. Population Studies of Morbidity]
Another major effort to test the Compression hypothesis has involved population studies over time. In the United States, two premier population studies in the United States were begun shortly after the Compression of Morbidity hypothesis was raised. The National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) [24, 25] studied Medicare eligible subjects 65 years old and older whether institutionalized or community-living (1982–2004) and the National Health Interview Study (NHIS) noninstitutionalized individuals over age 70 (1982–1999) [26]. Disability in the NLTCS declined 1.27% over the entire period and 2.1% in the last five years. NHIS had similar results, as did the next five studies as ranked by quality [27]. Mortality rates declined nationally about 1% per year over this period [28]. This documents the possibility of Compression of Morbidity on a national basis. It should be noted that not all studies have shown morbidity compression, particularly some European studies, and there has been speculation, and a little data, suggesting that the current obesity epidemic might reverse improvements of the prior two decades; the data presented here in the Risk Factor study could be considered to support this possibility. Unfortunately, the NLTCS had its last survey cycle in 2004, and more recent data from other sources cannot be directly compared to the NLTCS because of multiple changes in sampling designs and outcome variable definitions.

Population studies, because of their broad reach and policy implications, are of great value. Nevertheless, they are not particularly sensitive to change, and they generally offer little insight into the causes of the changes. National mortality and morbidity rates are influenced by economic cycles and offsetting trends in risks, as in rising population obesity and declining population cigarette smoking. They do not necessarily reflect a coherent population trend in health risks. It is not surprising that different countries have reported different trends, some of which differences do not appear to be attributable to methodology [29].

These studies provide proof-of-concept, in that the best studies since 1982 in the United States show convincing rates of Compression of Morbidity [30]. But, Compression of Morbidity, almost a necessity for progress in health improvement, clearly has not occurred in all populations and all subgroups [31].



[9. Need and Demand Reduction]
The Compression paradigm is central to health policy issues. If Compression of Morbidity occurs, it seems likely that the medical care burden would also go down. Costs of chronic diseases in senior citizens are a large driver of medical costs. Medical care costs are threatening the viability of the economy. Disability is a strong predictor of medical costs [32–34]. Health promotion programs which reduce senior health risks, as studied with large randomized trials, can reduce health risks and also reduce costs [11, 12, 32]. The policy formulation “reduction in need and demand for medical services,” suggests an approach to reducing medical care costs by reducing the illness burden and thus reducing the need for medical services [33, 34]. The “demand” side reflects a population tendency to desire the new and the expensive rather than the older and traditional.

Medical need theoretically may be moderated by improved lifestyle choices as described here, as well as use of medical self-care, hospices, advance directives, and other low-cost interventions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services currently is studying the role of interventions directed at the twin goals of improving health and reducing costs, and preliminary results of a large randomized multiyear study of such interventions in Medicare populations should be available soon [35]. The “Compression of Morbidity” is an important theoretical approach to both health improvement and medical care cost reduction [36].



[10. Trajectories of Morbidity: The Algebra of Health]
Another promising research agenda involves study of the discrete trajectories which collectively describe overall health outcomes in a population. Many factors other than personal health risks affect both population mortality and morbidity, and a current challenge is to catalog the positive or negative effects of such factors upon mortality and morbidity. In addition to health risk reduction and its association with compression of morbidity, other potential factors include safer cars, super highways, seat belts, neighborhoods, ethnicity, prompt treatment of stroke, hypertension control, glucose control, cholesterol control, total joint replacement, HIV/AIDS, gang murder, and suicide before mid-life.

Moreover, there are subsets of disease conditions that result in opposite trajectories, as with fatal and nonfatal heart attacks, fatal and non-fatal strokes, or resectable versus non-resectable cancer. For example, coronary artery disease has a trajectory of sudden mid-life death as the first symptom, a trajectory of sudden death with first symptom at an advanced age, a trajectory of multiple acute coronary events, and a trajectory of slow progression of chronic congestive heart failure.

The effects of coronary artery disease on the national morbidity and mortality thus require descriptive information on the several trajectories, the incidence of each, and the algebraic sum of trajectories as the impact of the disease condition. Deconstruction of the possible trajectories of a disease is followed by reconstruction. Presently available data as to the direction and magnitude of effect of disease trajectories permits conjecture but not conclusion [21, 36, 37]. Future advances in health assessment and health policy will require detailed study of the different trajectories of the same disease.

The new paradigm of “Active Aging” or “Compression of morbidity” aspires to improve human health. There is proof-of-concept. Future population health improvement will require theory, science, and strategy and will involve multiple disciplines of inquiry.

TITLE: Aging and Bone

ABSTRACT: Bones provide mechanical and protective function, while also serving as housing for marrow and a site for regulation of calcium ion homeostasis. The properties of bones do not remain constant with age; rather, they change throughout life, in some cases improving in function, but in others, function deteriorates. Here we review the modifications in the mechanical function and shape of bones, the bone cells, the matrix they produce, and the mineral that is deposited on this matrix, while presenting recent theories about the factors leading to these changes.

TITLE: Exponential increase in mortality with age is a generic property of a simple model system of damage accumulation and death

ABSTRACT: The risk of dying increases exponentially with age, in humans as well as in many other species. This increase is often attributed to the "accumulation of damage" known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of this paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in which mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation process is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage, i.e., length of the queue. The model has four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage occurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired at a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency of the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the mathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential dependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this dependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is modeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped by the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage accumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be useful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in real data. To exemplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted in the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born in 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher threshold to damage. This fits well with the many advances made in public health during the 20th century.

[Introduction]
In many biological organisms, including humans, mortality rate (force of mortality or hazard rate) is increasing with age [e.g., 1, 2]. This increase is often taken as a defining feature of biological aging, or senescence. A remarkable empirical finding, first described almost 200 years ago, is that the rate of increase in mortality, over a substantial age range, is roughly exponential [3]; see [4] and [5] for review. This exponential relationship is found in different populations of humans as well as in a range of other organisms, including fruit flies and nematodes. Moreover, the exponential dependence between age and mortality rate is seen also under experimental conditions where environmental, and to some extent genetic, forces are kept constant [e.g., 6]. In human populations, the age range over which there is an exponential relationship between age and mortality rate varies. In Swedish data, mortality is an approximately exponential function of age from 55 years of age [7, Ch.6].

A prominent idea, often evoked in explanations of why humans and other organisms age and die, is that damage, that inevitably occur in biological systems, accumulate over time, and the accumulated damage leads to organ failure, and finally death [e.g., 2, 8–11]. The “damage” featuring in these accounts is of many different kinds and occur to a range of different structures, including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and proteins [9]. The rate of damage accumulation, and hence of aging, is thought to be a result of the balance between damage and repair. There are a range of repair mechanisms, the most well studied repair damage to the DNA [12, 13]. Many of these repair mechanisms become less efficient with age [12], which implies that the rate of damage accumulation will increase with age.

The aim of this paper is to describe a family of models of damage accumulation and death, where there is an exponential dependence between rate of dying and age, a dependence that can be shaped by a small set of parameters having a clear interpretation. The description of damage accumulation in these models is taken from the mathematical theory of queues, and the process of accumulation is shaped by the balance between the rate of damage and rate of repair. The model systems “die” at a fixed rate when the accumulated damage exceeds a threshold, and if the rate of repair decreases in a roughly linear manner with age, mortality rates can be shown to be exponential functions of age.

In the simplest instantiation of such queuing-based models, there are four parameters that shape the relation between aging and mortality rate. The way in which mortality rate depends on the parameters is shown to be independent of the details of how the system is implemented, suggesting that model systems of this type could be useful in interpreting changes in real mortality data.

The paper is organized as follows. First a model system is studied where damage accumulation is modeled by an M/M/1 queue with time-changing repair (service) rate. This queuing model is well understood, and the mortality rates are shown to be well approximated by an exponential function of age. Second, it is shown that the relation between age and mortality is approximately exponential also when more general queuing models are used to describe the damage accumulation. Moreover, it is shown that these more general models can be parameterized in the same way as the model based on M/M/1-queues, and the effects of the parameters are the same in the two models. In the following sections numerical methods are used to study two cases not covered by the theory. First the case of when rate of damage accumulation exceeds rate of repair is considered. This is followed by a discussion of how heterogeneity can be introduced in these models. Subsequently, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted in the light of the damage accumulation models. In the Discussion, these model systems are related to some previously suggested models of similar type. In the S1 Appendix, numerical simulations are used to verify that the theoretical approximations accurately describe the dynamics of real systems, and it is furthermore shown that the assumption of a hard threshold can be relaxed.



[Damage accumulation modeled by an M/M/1 queue]
In this section, a well-known model of queuing behavior, the M/M/1 queue, is used to implement a system that ages, and moreover dies with a rate which depends exponentially on age. For an introduction to queuing theory see, for example, [14].

Assume that damage to the system occurs according to a Poisson process with constant rate λ (occurrence of damage corresponds to “arrival of customers” in queuing theory). Whenever there is damage, a repair process starts, and the time it takes to repair the damage follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter μ (repair corresponds to “service” in queuing theory). Assume further that there is at most one repair process active at any time, implying that subsequent damages might accumulate, even if λ < < μ; i.e., there might be a “queue” of damage. This last assumption is made to simplify derivations but can be relaxed without changing the results qualitatively, i.e., the results in this section hold also for M/M/c queues. Since damage happen at random times, and take random amounts of time to repair, the accumulated damage, Q(t) say, is a stochastic process on the non-negative integers (“queue length” in queuing theory). If λ < μ then Q has a stationary distribution, and this distribution will play a central role in the following. In this M/M/1 model, the stationary distribution of Q only depends on the ratio of damage to repair rate, ρ=defλ/μ (“traffic intensity” in queuing theory), and takes the following simple form [14, p.62]:
Pr(Q≥k)=defP(Q≥k)=ρk.

Fig 1 illustrates samples of Q(t) for three values of ρ and the insets show the corresponding stationary distributions. It can be seen that as ρ → 1, it becomes more probable that the accumulated damage (Q(t)) takes large values.

To turn this queuing model into a model of aging and death, two properties will be added. First, the rate of the repair process is made to decrease as a function of age (i.e., time), and, second, the risk of “death” will be linked to the accumulated damage Q(t).

To keep derivations simple, the following form for the decrease of μ is assumed:
μ(a)=μ0-βa.(1)
Here μ0 and β are constants, with μ0 > λ, and a denotes age. Accordingly, the rate of repair is decreasing linearly with age. Note that μ0 represents the initial repair capacity of the system, at age zero. If, as is the case for many human populations, the exponential dependence between mortality and age starts at an age a0 > 0, Eq 1 is replaced by μ(a) = μ0 − β(a − a0)+, where (x)+ denotes the positive part of x.

If μ is a function of age, then the distribution of Q(t) will also depend on age, and when μ changes, it will take some time before the distribution of Q conforms to the stationary distribution corresponding to the new value of ρ (see Fig 4 for an illustration). In fact, the time it takes for the stationary distribution to be approached is a rapidly increasing function of ρ [e.g., 15]. To accommodate this fact, it is further assumed that the rate of change of μ is slow compared to the time needed to approach the steady state distribution. This is achieved when the rate of damage is high compared to the rate of change of μ, i.e., when λ > > β. With this assumption in place, the stationary distribution of Q can be parameterized by age, P(Q(a)) as
P(Q(a)≥k)=ρ(a)k=def(λμ(a))k.(2)

To link the accumulated damage to risk of dying, the latter is assumed proportional to the probability of the accumulated damage exceeding a fixed threshold θ. In other words, the hazard of death at age a, h(a) say, is given by
h(a)∝P(Q(a)≥θ),(3)
where the threshold, θ, is a free parameter of the model system. In the S1 Appendix it is shown that similar behavior can be obtained with a soft threshold, a sigmoid function. The qualitative behavior of the system does not depend on the constant of proportionality, and it is assumed to be equal to one in the rest of this section. In applications, this constant is determined by the time units used. Given this form of the hazard function, it follows, from standard survival analysis theory, that the corresponding probability density function, f(a) say, is given by
f(a)=ρ(a)θexp(-∫a0aρ(s)θds),(4)
[e.g., 16, Ch.1]. Here a0 ≥ 0 to indicate that in real data the exponential dependence between age and mortality is often a restricted to a range of ages. Now we can state the

Main result. Under these assumptions it follows that the rate of dying increases approximately exponentially with the age of the system.

To see this, let Δ = μ0 − λ and use that
ρ(a)=11+Δ-βaλ.
Insert this in the expression for the probability of Q(a) (Eq 2) and take logarithms to yield
logP(Q(a)≥θ)=-θlog(1+Δ-βaλ).
Taylor expansion of the logarithm gives,
logP(Q(a)≥θ)=θβaλ-θΔλ+higherorderterms.(5)
In the regime that is relevant here, say when P(Q(a) ≥ θ) > 0.01, the higher order terms in the above expression makes only a negligible contribution and can be ignored (see Fig 2 for an example). Thus, in this range, the logarithm of P(Q) is very well approximated by a straight line. In other words, the probability that the accumulated damage exceed a given threshold θ is an exponential function of age. Indeed, if c1 = exp(−θΔ/λ), and c2 = θβ/λ, we have
P(Q≥θ)≃c1exp(c2a),(6)
or equivalently log(P) ≃ log(c1) + c2
a. Fig 2 illustrates how the error in the approximation goes to zero as P(Q ≥ θ) → 1.

Note that the assumption of a perfectly linear decrease of rate of repair (Eq 1) can be relaxed. The decrease does not need to be deterministic as long as the average decrease is roughly linear.



[Damage accumulation modeled by an M/M/1 queue - Effects of changes in parameters]
The model system has four parameters: μ0, λ, β, and θ, and the way mortality rate depends on these can be obtained by taking partial derivatives of P(Q) with respect to the parameters (e.g., using Eq 6). These dependencies are illustrated in Fig 3, which shows that changes in μ0 leads to a proportional change in the hazard rates, i.e., the hazard rate ratios between two systems that differ only in μ0 are constant. A change in the damage rate (λ) has similar effects (but with opposite sign), whereas a change in β leads to hazard rate ratios that increase with age, and a change in θ to hazard rate ratios that decrease with age.

Since the relation between age and log mortality rate is almost linear in this model, it can be adequately be described by just two parameters (see Fig 2). This implies that the four parameters of the model cannot be uniquely fit to a single set of data. For example, if μ0, λ, and β are all multiplied by the same constant, P(Q), as given by Eq 6, will not change. However, the point is not primarily to fit the model to a single set of data, but to interpret changes in mortality rates between different contexts in terms of parameters with a clear interpretation.



[Damage accumulation modeled by a G/G/1 queue]
To derive the approximate exponential dependence between age and mortality (Eq 6), it was assumed that damage happened according to a Poisson process and that the repair times were exponentially distributed. In this section it is shown that mortality rate is an approximately exponential function of age also when these assumptions are relaxed.

So, assume that damage occurs according to a stationary stochastic process, where the time intervals between damages are drawn from a distribution with mean value 1/λ and standard deviation σD. Assume further that repair times are drawn from a distribution with age-dependent mean value 1/μ(a) and standard deviation σR(a). Let ID and IR denote the square of the coefficient of variation of these distributions, e.g., ID = (λσD)2. When λ/μ → 1, it can be shown that the stationary distribution of accumulated damage, for a fixed age, Q(a), is approximately exponential [e.g., 17, Ch. 8]. Indeed, in this case we have that
P(Q(a)≥θ)≃exp(-2θμ(a)-λIRμ(a)+IDλ).(7)
To show that this expression entails an approximate exponential dependence between age and mortality rate, assume that ID does not depend (strongly) on age and use that
μ(a)-λIRμ(a)+IDλ=Δ-βaIR(Δ-βa)+(IR+ID)λ=Δ-βa(IR+ID)λ-IR(Δ-βa)2IR(IR+ID)λ(Δ-βa)+((IR+ID)λ)2.
Next, we show that the second term on the right hand side in the above expression is smaller than the first term and can be ignored when (μ − λ) → 0. To do this, let r denote the ratio between the second and the first term, i.e.,
|r|=IR(Δ-βa)IR(Δ-βa)+(IR+ID)λ.(8)
The absolute value used in this expression follows from the assumption that (Δ − βa) ≥ 0. Eq 8 implies that |r| < (Δ − βa)/λ, showing that |r| → 0, when (Δ − βa) → 0, demonstrating that the contribution of the second term can be ignored when (μ(a) − λ), and hence (Δ − βa) is small. Consequently, in this regime, we can approximate Eq 7 by
P(Q(a)≥θ)≃exp(-2θΔ-βa(IR+ID)λ),(9)
which shows that the probability of damage exceeding a given threshold is approximately an exponential function of age. Note that Eq 9 express the same dependence between P(Q) and the model parameters as does Eq 6. Furthermore, since the coefficients of variation is 1 for both damage and repair distribution in the M/M/1 model above, the approximation in Eq 9 becomes, in this case, identical to that in Eq 6.

To verify that the theoretical approximations derived in this section accurately describe the behavior of the model systems, direct numerical simulations of two systems were performed and the results of these were compared to the theoretical approximations (see S1 Appendix). Fig A2 in S1 Fig shows that the approximation of Eq 9, accurately captures the dependence between age and hazard rate, in particular as the rate of damage approaches the rate of repair.

To sum up, there are two factors explaining why there is an exponential dependence between age and mortality rate in these models. The first has to do with the shape of the stationary distributions of Q(t), geometric in the M/M/1 case, and exponential in the general case. This is a property of the queuing models used to describe the damage accumulation. The second factor is that the model systems are working in a regime where μ(a) → λ, i.e., where the repair rate is approaching the damage rate. In this regime, the stationary distributions have an approximately linear dependence on age. At this abstract level it is almost self evident that real biological systems must also be operating in this regime as they age. Indeed, if the rate of repair would continue to be much higher than the rate of damage, there would not be any accumulation of damage, and consequently, no aging.



[Behavior of models when λ > μ]
To derive analytical results for the model systems it has, so far, been tacitly assumed that λ < μ, i.e., that the rate of repair is higher than the rate of damage. When this condition fails, there is no stationary distribution and the probability of Q exceeding any threshold becomes equal to one. In other words, damage will accumulate without bounds and the probability that Q will exceed a fixed threshold θ becomes independent of age. Since stationary theory cannot be used to derive analytical expressions in this regime, numerical simulations (see S1 Appendix) were used to illustrate the behavior. Fig 4 shows results for one set of parameters. It is clear that as ρ gets close to 1, the simulated data starts deviating slightly from the theoretical prediction. This is a consequence of that it takes more time to reach the stationary distribution when ρ → 1. It is also clear from Fig 4 that the exponential increase in hazard rate, is seemingly completely gone when ρ ≥ 1, and the hazard of death becomes, to a first approximation, independent of ρ, and hence age.



[Heterogeneity]
The analytical results considered so far concerns the behavior of a large number of identical units. In populations of biological organisms it is likely to exist differences between organisms that affect their longevity. For example, females tend to outlive males in many animal species, and various experimental manipulations have been shown to systematically alter longevity in animal models [e.g., 2]. Such heterogeneity can easily be incorporated into the model systems described here. For example, if the initial level or repair capacity, μ0, is a random variable such that log(μ0) has a suitable gamma distribution, the resulting model would generate hazard rates, as a function of age, almost identical to the, so-called, gamma-Gompertz model, in which heterogeneity is modeled by a proportional scaling of the hazards [e.g., 18, 19]. A perhaps more principled choice would be to let the initial repair capacity be normally distributed; this would then instead imply a log-normal proportional frailty model. Another possibility is to let the damage rate λ vary between units. Analytical results for model systems where parameters vary according to a normal distribution have not been derived yet, but using numerical simulations, some consequences of heterogeneity is studied below.

A prominent feature of the gamma-Gompertz frailty model is that the hazard rates grow less fast at older ages. The reason for this is that those that survive to older ages tend to have a lower hazard than the average of the population [e.g., 20]. To show that this effect is also observed when heterogeneity is introduced in the model systems considered here, numerical simulations were run in which the initial repair rate μ0 was allowed to vary between units. In Fig 5, hazard rates from these simulations are compared to the hazard rates from a model without heterogeneity. The hazard rates are very similar until age 75 after which the rates in the population with heterogeneity show a slower increase. Similar results are obtained by allowing λ to vary (not shown).

Heterogeneity in μ0 or λ makes sense in terms of interpretation. Differences in the repair capacity between different individuals might be a result of genetic differences, and differences in rate of damage might be caused by living conditions and/or lifestyle (e.g., smoking, drinking alcohol). The effects of heterogeneity in other parameters is left for a separate communication.



[As a phenomenological model of real data]
In this section the model where damage accumulation is governed by an M/M/1 queue is fit to historical mortality data from Sweden. The purpose is to illustrate how the system can be used as a phenomenological model of real data, and thereby to aid in the interpretation. A more detailed analysis and discussion of results will be communicated separately.



[As a phenomenological model of real data - The data]
Mortality data for persons born in Sweden were obtained from the “Swedish Book of Deaths” issued by the The Federation of Swedish Genealogical Societies. This is a database compiled from a range of sources and contains information on time and place of births and deaths for persons that have died in Sweden since 1860. The coverage is almost complete.

Birth cohorts were formed for the two years 1885 and 1905, for men and women separately (men 1885: N = 58044, 1905: N = 64602; women 1885: N = 57873), 1905: N = 63284). These birth years were selected since it is known that the mortality rates for the 1905 cohort are significantly lower than the rates of the 1885 cohort. Hazard rates were estimated with a resolution of 1 year. To find the models that best fitted these four sets of data, a two-step procedure was used. First, a linear least squares fit was made to the log hazards for each cohort separately. The linear fits were restricted to an age range of 55-99 in order to capture the interval in which there is an exponential increase of mortality in these data, and to exclude older ages where the uncertainties of the hazard-rate estimates are large. The parameters from the least squares fits (two parameters per birth year and sex) were subsequently used to find the corresponding parameters of the model systems. This was accomplished by solving numerically the following system of equations for λ and θ:
co+c155=θlog(λμ0-β55)co+c190=θlog(λμ0-β90),
where c0 and c1 are the intercept and slope from the linear least squares fit to the log hazards. The other two model parameters, μ0 and β, were held fixed at 550 and 0.485/365. All computations were made in R [21].

Fig 6 shows hazard rates for the two birth years, for men and women separately. As is well known, the mortality rates for women dropped for almost all ages (the spikes around 14 years of age in the 1905 data, and 34 in the 1885 data, are attributed to the Spanish flu which hit Sweden in the fall of 1918). For men, mortality rates reduced for ages under 55, but did not change much for older ages. The lower panels show the data restricted to ages ≥ 55. The exponential increase in mortality rates is captured by the model (solid lines). The parameters that best describe these data show that the substantial decrease in hazard rates for women, after age 55, is accounted for by an increase in threshold θ; the rate of damage, λ, remained almost exactly the same in the two cohorts (Table 1). This increase in tolerance to damage is tentatively attributed to the the improvements in health care that occurred during the second half of the 20th century, e.g., in availability of antibiotics [22], as these improvements must have benefited those born 1905 more than those born 1885. An explanation for why mortality among men did not decrease to the same extent, among those aged 55 and older, might be found in the different rates in cigarette smoking in these two cohorts, and consequences thereof. Cigarette smoking became widespread among Swedish men in the 1940s, and were picked up by the two birth cohorts to a different extent [23, 24]. For example, according to a 1955 national survey on smoking and tobacco use, 41% of men aged 50-65 (i.e., including the 1905 birth cohort) were smoking cigarettes, whereas only 20% of men older than 65 did (i.e., including the 1885 birth cohort). Smoking among women in the corresponding age groups were 20 and 11% respectively [23]. A more careful investigation of these claims is left for a separate contribution. However, the fact that the model could account for the substantial change in mortality seen in women by a change in one sensible parameter is encouraging for further application to real mortality data.



[Discussion]
The model systems introduced herein accumulate damage and die with a rate that depends on the age of the system. If the decrease in the rate of repair is linear with age, mortality will increase exponentially, similarly to what is observed in many biological systems. It was shown that the exponential increase is independent of the interval distributions governing the damage and repair processes, demonstrating that this is a robust feature of these systems. The exponential dependence between age and mortality rates in these models is valid in a regime where the rate of repair becomes similar to the rate of damage as the systems age. Since aging, in both animals and humans, is associated with accumulation of damage [e.g., 2, 8–11], it is possible that the exponential relation between age and mortality also in these cases results from a similar balance of damage and repair.

In the current form, these model systems have four parameters, all with clear interpretations: rate of damage accumulation, initial rate of repair, rate of decrease of repair rate, and a threshold beyond which the accumulated damage can cause the system to die. Although it it possible to express the dynamics of the model with fewer parameters, such reparameterization would make the interpretation of the model harder. An important finding is that the way these parameters affect the relationship between age and mortality is independent of the details of the accumulation process. In other words, it is a generic feature of these systems. For example, an increase in the damage rate will lead to a proportional increase of the mortality rate (see Fig 3) in all models of this type. This generic property suggests that similar parameter dependencies might hold also in other (biological) systems. It was, for example, shown that the decrease in mortality rates among Swedish women born 1905, compared to those born 1885, could be well accounted for by an increase in just one parameter, θ, the threshold. This example also illustrates how model systems, where parameters have an intrinsic meaning, can be used to generate hypotheses about generative mechanisms, something that might be harder to do with descriptive (statistical) models of the data.

Apart from the exponential dependence between aging and mortality, human mortality data often show other regularities that a model should arguably be able to reproduce. One common finding is that the exponential increase in hazard rates levels off at old age, i.e., the increase in mortality with age, say after 95, becomes less fast (but this is not a universal finding, see [25]). In the models introduced here, such leveling off is achieved naturally when the rate of damage is close to, or surpasses, the rate of repair (Fig 4). Heterogeneity in the initial level of repair provides another way in which this behavior can be generated (Fig 5). Another common feature of human mortality data is a negative correlation between the intercept and slope when the log hazard is modeled as a linear function of age (i.e., a straight line), the so-called Gompertz model [26]. In the model systems considered here, such dependency is a consequence of changes in model parameters that influence both the slope and intercept of the log hazard, see Eq 6. For example, in populations were mortality rates change through a change in the threshold, there will be a strong negative correlation between the intercept and slopes in the corresponding Gompertz models. Consequently, these models give a functional explanation to why such a dependency might be found in real populations [c.f., 27].

Below I first discuss some ways in which these models can be extended. Subsequently, two conjectures concering the relation between parameters of the models and real data are put forth. Hopefully this makes the connections to real systems more clear. The paper concludes with a discussion of some related work.



[Discussion - Extensions]
There are many ways in which the family of damage-accumulation models considered here can be extended. One immediate extension would be to consider the accumulated damage, not as an integer-valued random variable, but a continuous ditto. In fact, the diffusion approximation underlying Eq 7, is an instance of a reflected Brownian motion [17]. This means that reflected (at zero) Brownian motion with a drift μ that is increasing as a function of age (initially μ < 0) provides an alternative model of damage accumulation. If μ is increasing linearly with age, this model will also lead to exponentially increasing mortality rates. Discrete models were used in this work because the parameters in these models are more intuitive, however, a continuous formulation might be preferable for analytical work.

Another way that the models could be extended would be to allow the rate of repair to depend on the accumulated damage. Indeed, in real systems, it is likely that the decrease in the efficiency of repair with age is itself a consequence of damage accumulation. If the rate of mortality would show the same dependency on age in this case is not known, but it is likely that it would be approximately true for certain types of dependencies.

Yet another extension concerns damage and repair processes that are non-stationary. If changes in the properties of these processes are slow, compared to the average interval duration, the results will not change qualitatively [e.g., 28]. Indeed, the linear decrease in μ with age, used in the models studied herein, is exactly such a slow change. If a model system with faster changes in damage and repair would still show an exponential dependence between mortality and age, or not, likely depends on the details of these changes.

To use the model systems studied here to model the mechanisms of aging in a particular organism would require additional steps. The damage and repair in the model systems should then be put in correspondence to some processes known to occur in the real system. In biological systems accumulation of damage happens at many different levels of organization (e.g., organelles, cells, functional modules, organs, etc), at different time-scales, and probably with different rates; and a biologically realistic model should be explicit about which levels are modeled and how different levels interact. Future work will explore how hierarchical combination of simple queuing models can be used to build more biologically realistic models of aging.



[Discussion - Two conjectures]
The main aim of this work was to show that an exponential increase in mortality rates is a generic consequence of damage accumulation in an abstract model system. Hopefully this theoretical work can contribute to more realistic models of biological mechanisms of aging. However, even at this abstract level it is possible to establish some tentative connections to real mortality data and therefore to mechanisms of aging. To this aim I will propose two testable conjectures regarding how established empirical findings relate to changes in model parameters.

Two of the four model parameters are related to external conditions of life: the rate of damage accumulation λ, and the threshold θ. It was already shown that the decrease in mortality among women born in Sweden could be fully accounted for by an increase in the threshold (Table 1). Exactly how different interventions translate to changes in the threshold is not known, but an improvement of, and increased access to, health care should correspond to a higher threshold. Thus, the increase in threshold found here is consistent with the marked improvements in health care in Sweden during the 20th century. The damage rate λ was considered constant in the models, however, in real biological systems it is likely that the rate of damage varies due to variations in external conditions. The first conjecture relates to this parameter:

A quantitative test of this conjecture is under way and will be communicated separately.

The other two model parameters, initial rate of repair, μ0, and rate of decay of the repair, β, supposedly reflect intrinsic properties of the organisms. For example, these are the parameters that would account for genetic differences in longevity in different populations. The amount of variation of longevity that can be attributed to genetic factors (i.e., heritability) has been shown to be in the order of 25 percent [31, 32]. If changes in μ0 or in β best account for these inheritable differences in longevity is not known. However, by comparing mortality rates of a population selected, on the basis of family data, to have longer life span, to rates from a population selected to have shorter life span, this question can be investigated empirically. Indeed, the second conjecture is:

This conjecture can be tested on data from twin studies, for example by comparing mortality rates of those who had a twin sibling that died after reaching a given age (80 years say) with those who’s twin siblings died before this age.



[Discussion - Relations to previous work]
A number of model systems previously described also generate mortality rates that increase more-or-less exponentially with age [e.g., 26, 33–37]. From a mathematical point of view, several of these models are similar to the ones presented here in that they also model a state variable that changes due to stochastic perturbations and the system dies when the state variable exceeds some given level. In fact, one of the models considered by Sacher and Trucco [33] is a one-dimensional Brownian motion with two absorbing boundaries, very similar, in kind, to the reflected Brownian motion mentioned above. However, the continuous formulation of that, and other, models makes it harder to interpret the model parameters in an intuitive way. For example, in the models that are formulated in terms of diffusion equations [33, 35] there is no natural connection between the drift term and the diffusion term. In the queuing framework suggested here, these terms are intrinsically connected since they are derived from a common underlying model. Furthermore, the discrete queuing-based models considered here arguably provide a simpler explanation for the exponential relation between age and mortality rates.

All these models, both previously described and the ones introduced in this work, are abstract in the sense of not being committed to any real system, and therefore it is not very meaningful to compare them in terms of “best fitting the data” (most of them will fit mortality data equally well), and the choice of model should instead be dictated by other criteria such as interpretability and usefulness as a tool to understand and explain data. I hope that the relative simplicity of the model systems introduced here, together with the ease at which they can be analyzed, understood, and fit to data, are convincing arguments for them to become useful complements to existing models.

In the present model there is a state variable, the accumulated damage, Q(t), the value of which determines the probability of dying. What this state variable might correspond to in a real aging organism remains to be determined. However, it is clear that it would have to be a summary measure somehow capturing the state of the organism at a given time point. Interestingly, there is a substantial body of work from Mitnitski, Rockwood and colleagues highly related to this issue. In a series of papers they have introduced and evaluated what they refer to as a “frailty index”, a composite measure of frailty, computed from a large number of frailty indicators [e.g., 10, 38, 39]. They have shown that the frailty index predicts mortality with higher accuracy than age alone, and have suggested that it could serve as a proxy for biological age Mitnitski Rockwood2015. In modeling work from the same group, they have used a framework very similar to the one proposed here to model how the frailty index evolves over time [10, 40]. In particular, they use the average queue length to represent the frailty index. Future work should explore the connection between Q(t) and frailty index in more detail.

TITLE: Aging by autodigestion

ABSTRACT: The mechanism that triggers the progressive dysregulation of cell functions, inflammation, and breakdown of tissues during aging is currently unknown. We propose here a previously unknown mechanism due to tissue autodigestion by the digestive enzymes. After synthesis in the pancreas, these powerful enzymes are activated and transported inside the lumen of the small intestine to which they are compartmentalized by the mucin/epithelial barrier. We hypothesize that this barrier leaks active digestive enzymes (e.g. during meals) and leads to their accumulation in tissues outside the gastrointestinal tract. Using immune-histochemistry we provide evidence in young (4 months) and old (24 months) rats for significant accumulation of pancreatic trypsin, elastase, lipase, and amylase in peripheral organs, including liver, lung, heart, kidney, brain, and skin. The mucin layer density on the small intestine barrier is attenuated in the old and trypsin leaks across the tip region of intestinal villi with depleted mucin. The accumulation of digestive enzymes is accompanied in the same tissues of the old by damage to collagen, as detected with collagen fragment hybridizing peptides. We provide evidence that the hyperglycemia in the old is accompanied by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor. Blockade of pancreatic trypsin in the old by a two-week oral treatment with a serine protease inhibitor (tranexamic acid) serves to significantly reduce trypsin accumulation in organs outside the intestine, collagen damage, as well as hyperglycemia and insulin receptor cleavage. These results support the hypothesis that the breakdown of tissues in aging is due to autodigestion and a side-effect of the fundamental requirement for digestion.

[Introduction]
Aging is accompanied by a loss of numerous cell and tissue functions, clinically manifest co-morbidities with increased susceptibility to diseases, and eventually by full organ failure at the time of death. A spectrum of biological processes (cell and mitochondrial functions, stem cell proliferation and differentiation, genetic lesions, histones, DNA repair mechanisms, epigenetics, protein folding, intra- and inter-cellular signaling, nutrient utilization) become dysregulated, unstable, and exhausted [1]. Vascular and immunological cell functions become impaired with pathological restructuring and development of age-related risk factors and diseases [2]. Different tissues share molecular and cellular mechanisms for micro- and macrovascular pathologies in aging [2,3].

Aging is also accompanied by chronic low-grade markers for inflammation [4,5]. Since the inflammatory cascade fundamentally serves tissue repair [6], a chronic mechanism exists in aging that causes tissue damage. In all organs, the cells and the extracellular matrix are degrading, for which mechanisms due to reactive oxygen species, radiation exposure, and repeat small injuries have been proposed [7–12]. However, none has been universally accepted to explain the source of cell dysfunctions and inflammation in aging.

We postulate here a previously unexplored mechanism for aging due to autodigestion [13,14] involving the digestive enzymes. After synthesis in the pancreas, they are discharged into the duodenum and small intestine where they degrade large masses of biomolecules daily. Inside the small intestine, digestive enzymes are concentrated (at a mM level), fully activated, and relatively non-specific to facilitate the breakdown of diverse polymeric food sources into lower molecular weight monomeric-size nutrients. Autodigestion of one’s intestine is primarily prevented by compartmentalizing the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine by the mucin/epithelial barrier [15]. While this barrier is permeable to small molecular weight nutrients (ions, amino acids, monosaccharides, etc.), normally it has a low permeability to larger molecules, such as pancreatic digestive enzymes [16].

During aging, the permeability of the intestinal barrier was reported to shift insignificantly for relatively low-molecular-weight sugars [17] but its properties remain unknown for molecules the size of digestive enzymes. We showed that even during a single meal, the permeability of digestive proteases may increase so that their enzyme activity is detectable in the circulation [18]. Thus, we hypothesize that digestive enzymes leak daily across the mucin-epithelial barrier into tissues and organs outside the pancreas and intestines, where they damage the extracellular matrix and attenuate multiple cell functions characteristic of aging.

Accordingly, we determined in rats of old age the transport of key digestive enzymes (including trypsin, elastase, lipase, and amylase) out of the small intestine past the mucin/epithelial barrier and their accumulation in peripheral organs. Digestive proteases cause multiple forms of tissue damage, including degradation of collagen and cleavage of membrane receptors (e.g. the insulin receptor) [19]. Treatment of old rats for 14 days with a pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (tranexamic acid) [16] attenuates the breakdown of the mucin barrier, reduces the accumulation of digestive enzymes in peripheral organs, collagen degradation, and reduces insulin receptor cleavage and hyperglycemia in old rats.



[Methods - Animals and tissue collection]
Animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Wistar rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc., Indianapolis, IN) at maturity (4 months, 300 to 350 gm) and at old age (24 months, 375 to 450 gm) were included in the study. The animals were maintained on standard laboratory chow (8604 Teklad rodent diet; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, Ind) without restriction and water ad libitum and maintained in a separate room without pathogen-free conditions. They were confirmed to exhibit normal mobility, water and food consumption, and fecal material discharge. Animals that exhibited signs of morbidities were excluded. A subgroup of old animals was given a serine protease inhibitor (tranexamic acid, 14 days) in drinking water (137 mM, exchanged daily) which at a minimum fluid consumption of 40 ml/day amounts to a minimum dose of 0.39 gm/kg/day.

A femoral venous catheter was placed after general anesthesia (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg [Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill], intramuscularly after local anesthesia [2% lidocaine HCl; Hospira, Inc, Lake Forrest, Ill]). Tissues (intestine, liver, lung, heart, kidney, brain, mesentery, skin) were immediately collected after euthanasia (Beuthanasia i.v., 120 mg/kg, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp, Union, NJ), fixed (formalin, 10%, neutral buffered, 1 hr), postfixed (fresh formalin, 24 hrs), and stored (formalin, 10%). The period between initial anesthesia and fixation of the tissues was below 60 minutes. All tissues were excised with sharp blades to minimize the stretching of collagen before fixation.



[Methods - Tissue sections]
Formalin-fixed tissues were cut into sections with a vibratome (thickness 40 μm; Pelco Lancer Vibratome Series 1000). The areas of the section were kept above ~3 mm x ~5 mm to permit analysis of digestive enzyme infiltration over diverse regions within an organ.

To generate thin sections for the intestine, a segment of the upper jejunum was embedded in resin (Araldite; Polysciences, Washington, PA) and cut into 1 μm sections (Ultramicrotome, LKB Ultratome Nova). The resin was removed with Maxwell solution (2 g KOH in 10 ml absolute methyl alcohol + 5 ml propylene oxide) [20], rinsed in tap water, incubated in hydrogen peroxide (4%, 1 minute), rinsed (phosphate buffer), and immunolabeled for trypsin (see below).



[Methods - Digestive enzyme immunohistochemistry]
To determine on the tissue sections the immunolabel density and distribution of digestive enzymes, the following primary antibodies were used: pancreatic trypsin MoAb (D-1): sc-137077(Santa Cruz); pancreatic elastase (ELA1) polyclonal antibody (Biomatik); pancreatic lipase MoAb (A-3): sc-374612 (Santa Cruz); amylase MoAb (G-10): sc-46657 (Santa Cruz). Primary antibodies were diluted to 1–1.5 μl/1000μl of phosphate-buffered saline. They were followed by secondary antibodies (MP-7601 for anti-rabbit IgG; MP-7602 for anti-mouse IgG; ImmPRESS Excel staining kit peroxidase). Two substrate colors were used, red (ImmPactTM AEC Substrate kit peroxidase, sk-4205; Vector®Laboratories) and brown (ImmPACTTM DAB [3,3’-diaminobenzidine] Substrate kit peroxidase, sk4105; and Vectorstain Elite ABC-HRP Kit, Vector®Laboratories). Sections without primary antibodies served as controls. No counterstain was applied to facilitate quantitative label intensity measurements. The concentrations and exposure of primary and secondary antibodies applied to the sections were adjusted (24 hrs and according to protocol by Vector Laboratories, respectively) to achieve full penetration of the antibodies into the tissue sections. For each tissue, the labeling procedures were standardized among the animal groups to permit a quantitative comparison of label densities between ages and treatment with digital image analysis.



[Mesentery]
The trypsin distribution in intact mesentery sectors was delineated by biotin/avidin immunolabeling with MoAB (D-1), secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, MP-7602, ImmPRESS Excel staining kit peroxidase, Vector®Laboratories) with a brown substrate (ImmPACT DAB sk-4105).



[Collagen damage labeling]
To localize molecular level subfailure of collagen with specificity [21], sections were labeled with biotin-conjugated collagen hybridizing peptides (B-CHP) that bind unfolded collagen by triple helix formation. The trimeric CHP are thermally dissociated to monomers before use (80°C for 10 min), the hot CHP solution is quickly cooled to room temperature (by immersion into 4°C water for 15 sec), diluted (1 μl in 1000 μl phosphate buffer saline, applied solution 7.5 mM) and immediately applied to the section (dead time <1 min). In this way, most CHP peptides are expected to remain as active monomers during the staining process, based on kinetic studies on CHP triple helix folding [22]. Sections are incubated overnight at room temperature, and unbound B-CHP is washed (3 times in 1ml of 1xPBS for 30min at room temperature). To visualize the B-CHP, the tissue sections are incubated with streptavidin peroxidase (sk-5704, Vector®Laboratories, according to manufacturer instructions) and then to a substrate (ImmPact AEC Substrate Kit Peroxidase; sk-4205, Vector Laboratories) at room temperature (for periods between 1 and 10 min depending on the tissue). The B-CHP label intensity on the sections is recorded by digital brightfield microscopy (40x, numerical aperture 0.5).



[Glucose analysis]
At the time of tissue collection, fresh femoral arterial blood was used to measure the blood glucose level (Contour, Bayer Diabetes Care, Tarrytown, NY) and the percent of glycated hemoglobin levels (A1C Home Test; Bristol-Myers-Squibb Co; NY, NY).



[Glucose analysis - Brain insulin receptor density]
Measurements of insulin receptor density were carried out by immunolabeling its extracellular domain on fixed tissue sections (10% formalin, neutral buffered) with a primary antibody (M-20, sc-57344 HRP, monoclonal antibody mapping to the N-terminus, Santa Cruz®Biotech) and visualize with a substrate (ImmPACT AEC Substrate kit peroxidase, SK-4205, Vector Laboratories). Sections without primary antibodies were used as negative controls.



[Glucose analysis - Digital image analysis]
Images of the immunolabel density were recorded at multiple magnifications (between 10x objective, numerical aperture 0.25, and 60x, numerical aperture 1.4). They were recorded under standard light conditions with fixed optical and digital camera settings (Spot Insight GIGABIT camera, Sterling Height) so that the camera serves as a quantitative light intensity meter without pixel intensity saturation. Images were analyzed digitally (Photoshop, Adobe 24.4.1.; spatial resolution of 640x480 pixels).

The red color of the biotin-conjugated collagen hybridizing peptides and the red immune substrates was digitally extracted and their intensity was measured on a B/W scale (1 to 256 digital units between white and black, respectively). The density of the immune substrate label was measured in the form of digital light intensity (I) at a constant incident light intensity (Io) without a tissue section.

Insulin receptors’ densities on random tissue sections, labeled with an antibody against the extracellular domain, are digitally recorded by placing an optical window on the cell and determining light intensity at a constant incident light Io.

Unless specified otherwise, the mean label density per group (3 animals/group) is determined from the average label density per animal (5 tissue sections/animal, ~10 images/section).



[Glucose analysis - Statistics]
Measurements are summarized as mean ± standard deviation. For comparisons between young and old, an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in outcomes of interest among groups. Results were determined to be significant at p<0.05. Bonferroni’s post hoc multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance between individual groups. To obtain statistically conclusive results, the minimum number of animals was estimated assuming equal variances among groups, α = 0.05 and β = 1–0.9. No animals were excluded from the analysis.



[Results - Digestive enzyme accumulation in old organs outside the gastrointestinal tract]
In young rats, all tissues in this study (intestinal wall, mesentery, liver, lung, heart, kidney, brain, skin) (Figs 1–3) exhibit low immunolabel density for pancreatic trypsin. Compared to other tissues of the young, the villi of the small intestine and the lung tissue, have a slightly enhanced trypsin label intensity.

In contrast, the tissues of old rats have a significantly increased trypsin label density (Figs 1–3). High densities are on sections of the intestine, liver, and lung, organs that are in the pathway of digestive enzymes leaking from the small intestine, including the venules of the mesentery (Fig 3B). Trypsin labels are enriched in extracellular spaces (e.g. between heart muscle cells), in the wall of capillaries (e.g. brain) (Fig 2, arrows), and in the follicles of the skin.

Pancreatic elastase, lipase, and amylase also exhibit low immunolabel densities in young tissues, which is increased in the old (Figs 4–6, respectively). The labeling pattern of the pancreatic enzymes is also tissue-type specific (e.g. with interstitial accumulation between myocytes or in the microvasculature of the brain). However, the average label density is relatively uniform within each old organ as seen by the label density variances (<10%) across individual tissue sections (Figs 4–6, histograms). The measurements suggest that key pancreatic digestive enzymes have uniformly infiltrated the vital organs of old rats outside the pancreas in addition to the villi of the upper jejunal intestine.

Two-week treatment of the old rats with oral small molecular weight trypsin inhibitor significantly reduces the accumulation of trypsin in these vital organs and the skin (Figs 1–3, old treated groups) although not to the low level of the young. An exception is the brain, which exhibits trypsin label density in old treated rats that almost reaches the level in the young (no significant difference) (Fig 2). After the treatment of old rats, we also see low trypsin label densities in the mesentery that are not different from the young (Fig 3B).



[Results - Intestinal mucin-epithelial barrier and digestive enzyme accumulation in the small intestine]
The villi in the upper jejunal segment of the rat small intestine have an elongated crest shape, with an alignment parallel to the long axis of the intestine (Fig 7). The capillary network inside the villi crests is preserved in the old (S1 Fig).

The mucin layer on the epithelium of the small intestine, a barrier for digestive enzymes [16], has significantly reduced density in the aged, both on and between villi crests (Fig 7). Co-labeling of mucins and pancreatic trypsin or amylase in the intestine demonstrates that the reduced mucin density in the old is accompanied by accumulation of trypsin and amylase in the intestinal wall, both when measured at the villi tips and at the level of the submucosa (Fig 8). The oral trypsin inhibitor treatment partially restores the mucin layer in the old (Fig 7) and attenuates the accumulation of these digestive enzymes in the intestinal wall (Fig 8).

The loss of mucin in the old includes goblet cell-associated mucin 13 (arrows) on the epithelial brush border and mucin 2 from goblet cells (Fig 9A). Thin crossections of the intestinal villi in the old show that the highest density of trypsin is at their tip, especially inside the residual cavities of goblet cells after mucin discharge, and in the epithelial brush border with reduced mucin label (Fig 9B). Traces of trypsin label is detectable in the lamina propria, the microvasculature, lymphatics, and the intestinal serosa (see also Fig 1).



[Results - Collagen degradation]
Organs of the young have low levels of collagen damage, detected by hybridizing peptides. In contrast, old organs have uniformly enhanced collagen damage in all organs we studied (Figs 10–12). The damage is significantly reduced by the two-week oral treatment with trypsin inhibitor.

Whereas in the intestine collagen damage is present in the young and the old, more villi in the old exhibit damage. The tips of the villi have the highest collagen damage in both young and old, which coincides with the location where digestive enzymes cross the mucin epithelial barrier (Fig 9B). The old have more villi and larger tissue areas in the lamina propria with collagen damage. The serosa also exhibits collagen damage in young and old at the same location where trypsin has accumulated (Fig 9B).

In the heart muscle, collagen degradation is accompanied by an expansion of the interstitial space between muscle fibers (Fig 11). In the brain, it is diffused throughout the tissue and enhanced in the wall of capillaries (Fig 11). In the skin, collagen damage occurs in all collagen fibers of the epidermis and dermis of the old (Fig 12). Just like in all other organs we studied it is reduced by oral blockade of pancreatic trypsin.



[Results - Insulin receptor cleavage]
To determine whether digestive proteases may be involved in membrane receptor cleavage we investigated the insulin receptor in the brain, an organ distant from the intestine. Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor [23] shows its distribution in the cerebral cortex of the rat. The density of the insulin receptor ectodomains is significantly reduced in the aged, compared to the young, and in part restored after two-week trypsin inhibition (Fig 13A). It coincides with an increase of plasma glucose levels in the old without but not with the trypsin treatment (Fig 13B).



[Discussion]
The current results in the rat bring to light a fundamental mechanism for progressive multi-tissue degradation in the aged that is a consequence of the need to digest. Whereas located in the lumen of the small intestine, we find multiple types of pancreatic digestive enzymes in organs outside the lumen of the intestine of the old and less in the young. Pancreatic enzymes appear even in the brain indicating that they have breached two main barriers, the intestinal epithelial and the blood-brain barrier. As demonstrated in the case of pancreatic trypsin, the enzymes escape across the mucin-epithelial barrier in the small intestine and accumulate in vital organs. The digestive enzymes trigger a hallmark of aging, as detected by the breakdown of collagen, and they generate signatures for insulin resistance in the form of hyperglycemia and extracellular insulin receptor cleavage. A two-week treatment of old rats with trypsin inhibitor restores in part the mucin-epithelial barrier, reduces the trypsin accumulation in vital organs, attenuates the collagen degradation, and restores in part the insulin receptor density and the blood glucose level in the old.



[Discussion - Digestive enzyme compartmentalization in the gastrointestinal tract]
These results are in line with the central role of the gastrointestinal tract and the digestive enzymes in several diseases [24] and multiorgan failure and death [13]. A key requirement for the prevention of the degrading actions of the pancreatic digestive enzymes outside the gastrointestinal tract is their compartmentalization inside the lumen of the pancreatic ducts and small intestine by the mucin/epithelial barrier [25]. This barrier can be breached by multiple mechanisms, including but not limited to the reduction of the oxygen supply [16], the presence of partially digested food constituents [26], and unbound free fatty acids [27]. Even in the young, the tip of the villi is infiltrated by digestive enzymes while also the site for epithelial cell apoptosis [28], suggesting that repeat injury and continuous growth of villi is part of a normal cycle during digestion [29]. However, the current evidence suggests that chronic reconstitution of the intestinal villi is incomplete with reduced mucin density and enhanced digestive enzyme leak (Figs 7–9).



[Discussion - Transport pathways for digestive enzymes out of the intestine]
Once digestive enzymes leak across the epithelium/mucin barrier into the lamina propria of the intestinal villi, three pathways serve to reach the systemic circulation. Digestive enzymes can be carried (a) via the intestinal microcirculation and the portal venous system, (b) via the intestinal and the mesenteric lymphatics [30] and the lymphatic ducts into the venous circulation, bypassing the liver, and (c) across the submucosa, the muscularis, and the serosa of the intestine into the peritoneal fluid [31]. The elevated label densities in the intestine and the liver of old rats for pancreatic lipase, elastase, and amylase, suggest a pathway predominantly via intestinal venules and hepatic portal veins. Other pathways involved in different stages of aging remain to be determined.

Within old organs, all tissue regions have an elevated digestive enzyme label density (Figs 1–6). The density is enhanced in the extracellular space (e.g. between heart muscle fibers; Fig 2), consistent with the fact that as water-soluble proteins without known membrane receptors digestive enzymes have no effective transport mechanisms across intact cell membranes [32].



[Discussion - Digestive protease activity in aging]
Pancreas digestive enzymes that escape out of the small intestine are in an active form following conversion from their proform by enterokinases in the duodenum [33]. Their activity in plasma and organs outside the intestine depends, however, on the levels of endogenous inhibitors (e.g. serpins synthesized in the liver) and serve to control digestive enzyme activity. However endogenous inhibitors can be overwhelmed when larger amounts of digestive enzymes pass through the epithelial/mucin barrier into plasma, e.g. in an acutely ischemic intestine [16] or during a postprandial period even in the young [18]. The digestive enzyme activity, as a balance between digestive enzymes, breakdown products they produce, and inhibitor concentrations, remains to be determined with in-vivo zymographic techniques in aging.



[Discussion - Tissue degradation by pancreatic digestive proteases]
Digestive enzymes are optimized to degrade most biological tissues. Inside the lumen of the intestine, they are in high concentrations, in an active state, and are relatively non-specific. Pancreatic trypsin, for example, degrades most proteins irrespective of the source and causes cell dysfunctions.

Once digestive proteases have breached the mucin/epithelial barrier they in turn break down the mucin layer [16], cleave the extracellular domain of interepithelial junction proteins (E-cadherin), open the epithelial brush border, and even destroy the villi [15,34]. Upon entry into organs outside the intestine, numerous cell and tissue functions are at risk by active digestive enzymes. Pancreatic trypsin in the circulation triggers the activation of proMMPs [35,36]. The protease activity leads to ectodomain receptor cleavage and the reduction of their cell functions, such as cleavage of the insulin and leptin receptors with associated insulin and leptin resistance [18,23,37]. The extent of surface receptor and glycocalyx cleavage in different organs of the old remains to be investigated and may constitute a mechanism for their spectrum of attenuated cell functions (e.g. protein homeostasis, nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion, intercellular communication) [38] and chronic inflammation [39].

A key finding of the current study is the extensive cleavage of collagen in the organs we investigated (Figs 10–12). The breakdown of the collagen structure, detectable with hybridizing peptides binding to fractures in the triple-helical collagen molecule, can be produced either by mechanical stress or by exposure to proteases (e.g. trypsin) [40] and precedes the collagen restructuring or loss of fibers. Collagen damage promotes the disassembly of integrin attachments [41], and integrin-dependent cell behavior [42], and enhances apoptosis [43]. Collagen damage mediated by pancreatic digestive proteases and the secondary enzymes they activate may thus be a central mechanism for biological aging.

The tissue degrading processes by digestive enzymes are in line with the coincidence of chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes) during aging and multiorgan failure at the end of life. Our evidence supports the idea that a slow leak of digestive enzymes out of the gastrointestinal tract may lead to the gradual progression of organ dysfunction in aging [18], whereas a major breach of the mucin-epithelial barrier with a rapid escape of digestive enzymes leads to acute organ failure [34].



[Discussion - Digestive protease inhibition]
The current evidence indicates that the accumulation of digestive enzymes in tissues outside the gastrointestinal tract in the old can be reduced by two-week oral trypsin inhibition. This intervention needs to be nuanced to block autodigestion but not digestion. Even though the trypsin inhibitor in this study was administered orally, the concentration in the drinking water was kept sufficiently low so that a temporary treatment did not lead to a detectable attenuation of digestion, such as a reduction of body weight. The strategy served to restore the mucin layer on the intestinal villi (Fig 7), reduce the leak of digestive enzymes into the intestinal wall (Figs 1, 4 and 8), and accumulation of digestive enzymes in organs outside the intestine (Figs 1–6).



[Discussion - Aging interventions and autodigestion]
In multiple species, caloric reduction without starvation or timed eating attenuates age-associated morbidities [44,45]. The autodigestion hypothesis may provide an insight for such a benefit. A single meal can be accompanied by an instantaneous leakage of digestive enzymes into the central circulation within less than an hour of food consumption [18]. Reduction in the daily frequency and the volume of food passing through the small intestine may attenuate damage to the mucin/epithelial barrier and consequently reduce enzyme leak. In light of the continuous repair of the intestinal epithelium [46], prolonging the periods between meals may enhance the reconstitution of the microvilli and the epithelial/mucin barrier and thereby minimize autodigestion. The exact chronology of intestinal damage by leaking digestive enzymes and repair of the villi with their mucin/epithelial barrier during and after a meal remains to be elucidated.

TITLE: Anti-aging and Sunscreens: Paradigm Shift in Cosmetics

ABSTRACT: Skin, being one of the vital organs and a protective barrier needs to be pampered and taken care of from early childhood. It is the most visible and the widest exposed organ and by far reflects the general health condition and the aging process in humans. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to this complex biological process of skin aging. In recent times, skin health and its beauty is perceived as an indicator of one's health which has resulted in an increasing demand for anti-aging products. Exposure to UV radiation is considered to be one of the factors responsible for aging termed as photoaging. In this review, we have discussed the various factors which may accelerate the process of skin aging. Various approaches and strategies to delay the process of skin aging have been emphasized upon. The patents filed in the area of anti-aging and sunscreen products have also been reviewed to gain an insight into the new formulations which have been developed as an anti-aging product. There has been a tremendous rise in the cosmetic and cosmeceuticals market with products having a dual activity of anti-aging and sun protection. Research is constantly on the rise to ensure the safety of these products. Alternatives to the current topical application of sunscreen are being considered to overcome the drawback of reapplication of the sunscreen often which can be a boon to the cosmeceutical market.

FULL TEXT:

[Introduction]
Skin is a protective layer of the body of any animal including humans. As the age progresses, certain changes occur in the skin which are influenced by certain extrinsic and intrinsic factors.1 The changes in the skin are among the most visible signs of aging which include wrinkles, sagging skin, age spots and dryness, and also loss in the fat making the skin lose its natural smoothness. The skin is mainly composed of three layers, the outer part epidermis, middle part dermis, and the innermost subcutaneous layer. As a person ages, the epidermis slowly thins even though the number of cell layers remains same.2 The inherent repairing ability of skin gradually reduces as a person ages which may be due to infections and pressure ulcers. In addition, the number of melanocytes decreases, aging skin becomes thinner, paler and clear with large pigment spots, age spots or liver spots. All these signs necessitates the need for the anti-aging treatment.3 As we age, our body produces less collagen and elastin which plumps our skin and makes it lose its elasticity respectively. By the use of anti-aging products or treatment, either the collagen production can be boosted, or its natural loss can be slowed down.4 Anti-aging treatments are also necessary to reduce fine lines, wrinkle, acne and it also helps in making the skin firm.

Although sun-exposure is very essential for the synthesis of vitamin D, exposure to harmful UV rays results in premature aging, initiation of the reactive oxygen species generation, skin cancer, and degradation of extracellular matrix components viz, collagen type I, fibronectin, elastin and proteoglycans induced by mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway upregulation. Application of sunscreens to the exposed parts of the skin may help in protecting the skin from harmful UV rays. Sunscreens are the products combining several ingredients which protect the skin by absorbing, blocking or scattering UV radiation.5 Two types of agents protect the skin from sunlight, one which reflects the UV rays and the other which absorbs the UV rays. Reflectors are the substances which when present on the surface of the skin reflects the UV rays thus preventing them from entering the skin. Absorbers absorb the sunlight, and they are active against a specific spectrum of sunlight. So these can be used individually or in combination to act as a sunscreen. The sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor of 15 (SPF15) should be used to obtain the maximum benefit.6

In the present review, we have discussed on the aging mechanisms and various strategies to combat the various signs of aging. We have also touched upon the advances in the field of nanotechnology and its importance for the delivery of cosmeceuticals having anti-aging and sun protecting effect.



[Skin aging and its mechanism]
Skin aging is a complex biological process involving a blend of multiple components. Although the underlying mechanism of skin aging is not yet completely understood, multiple pathways were illustrated which were speculated to be responsible for skin aging namely changes in DNA repair and stability, mitochondrial function, cell cycle and apoptosis, ubiquitin-induced proteolysis, and cellular metabolism. The most vital factor responsible for skin aging may be a decline in the physiological hormone.7 UV radiations contribute about 80% in the skin disease development including skin aging and skin cancer.8 Thus UV radiation is a causative factor for skin aging.9 Repeated exposure to UV increases the degradation of collagen and alters the synthesis of new collagen accompanied by alterations in elastin fibers. The absence of both collagen and elastin in the skin leads to loss of its flexibility and strength.10 In addition, the skin also loses the ability to repair itself. The different causes of aging are depicted in Figure 1.



[Factors responsible for skin aging]
Most of the changes occurring in the skin may be attributed to a mix of both, endogenous/intrinsic and exogenous/extrinsic factors. Intrinsic aging causes changes in the epithelial cell layer whereas extrinsic aging causes abnormal accumulation of elastic tissue in the dermis.



[Factors responsible for skin aging - Intrinsic factors]
It is an endogenous mechanism of aging due to hormonal changes, genetic factors and cellular mechanisms, and several other mechanisms.

Free radical mechanism: To maintain equilibrium in our body there is a constant generation and removal of the free radicals. An imbalance in this process results in the formation of excessive free radicals which are toxic to the body and cause aging.11

In the process of intrinsic aging, these free radicals are formed by oxidative cellular metabolism. The free radicals produced in the process, are removed by anti-oxidative mechanisms, but as the age progresses, there is a decrease in the anti-oxidative mechanisms and eventually excessive free radicals in our body which leads to cellular aging.12

Hormonal mechanisms: The skin aging takes place by certain modification in growth factors and hormonal activity. The decline in several hormones in our body such as estrogen, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate ester and also melatonin, insulin, cortisol, thyroxine, and growth hormone can deteriorate several skin functions.13 In postmenopausal women, there is a decline in the estrogen levels which results in several aging signs such as dryness, wrinkles, loss of elasticity, collagen breakdown and epidermal atrophy.12

Mitochondrial DNA damage: Mitochondria consume oxygen and produce energy, and as a result, there is a continuous production of reactive oxygen species. These reactive oxygen species causes oxidative stress after exhaustion of cellular defense mechanisms and they also cause further mutation of mitochondrial DNA. These mitochondrial DNA cause high mutation rates because of inefficient recognition and repair mechanism.12 This damaged mitochondrial DNA produces less energy which affects the energy supply to the cells which in turn lead to cellular dysfunction. The damaged mitochondria undergo degeneration, rupture, leakage which are the prime reasons for aging.11

Role of telomere: Telomere protects the chromosomes from degradation and also prevents cellular DNA damage. Due to shortening of the telomeres, the t-loop configuration is disrupted which initiates DNA damage response, apoptosis, senescence or cell cycle arrest. Hence the shortening of the telomeres is responsible for intrinsic aging and photoaging.14



[Factors responsible for skin aging - Extrinsic factors]
Smoking: Smoking damages the collagen and elastic fibers in the dermis which makes the skin more slack, hardened and less elastic. Nicotine, carbon monoxide and other toxic substances produced during smoking result in vasoconstrictive and hypoxic effects on the skin. These contribute to premature skin aging.15

Ultraviolet (UV) radiations: About 80% of the facial aging is attributed to sun exposure. Photo damaged skin contributes for loss of skin elasticity, skin roughness and dryness, irregular pigmentation and deep wrinkling.16

Life style: It also has a major impact on aging. Lack of exercise, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, pollution, stress contributes to aging. Certain lifestyle factors cause an increase or decrease in the rate of telomere shortening. Ensuring a healthy lifestyle is important in reducing the telomere shortening and thus slowing down the aging process.17



[Oxidative stress in aging]
Oxidative stress has been linked to age-related loss of elasticity of the skin. The main cause of oxidative stress is the presence of excessive reactive oxygen species. In normal conditions, they are produced in our body during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria; however, these are inactivated by cellular antioxidant defense mechanism. Oxidative stress triggers cellular damage pathways and causes senescence of cells which may lead to photoaging. Exposure to UV rays specifically UVA rays can alter the levels of reactive oxygen species and the protective antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and catalases.18 The reactive oxygen species generated not only cause skin aging but also acts as a toxic agent in developing cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases and numerous skin diseases.19 UVB radiations also initiate photochemical production of reactive oxygen species mainly superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. To reduce the effect of this damaging solar radiation, sunscreens can be used which protects the skin from harmful sun exposure. Oxidative stress can also be reduced by dietary changes and special nutrients, and thereby reduce skin damage process.8



[Signs and mechanism of skin aging]
Wrinkles and sagging of the skin are the two major signs of skin aging. The underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. The wrinkled skin has an accumulation of altered elastic fibers and degradation of collagen bundles in the dermis. Enhanced elastase activity in dermal fibroblasts is mainly associated with UVB wrinkling mechanism. The activation of cytokine expression in epidermal keratinocytes by UVB irradiation causes the secretion of IL-1α and GM-CSF which penetrates into the dermis. This stimulates the expression of skin fibroblast elastase which cleaves the elastase fibers leading to a loss in its configuration thereby leading to reduced skin elasticity leading to wrinkle formation.20



[Prevention of aging]
Different approaches are available for the prevention and delay of skin aging. Extrinsic aging is largely preventable than intrinsic aging. Photoprotection helps to prevent skin aging which includes the use of sunscreens, protective clothing and sunglasses, avoiding sun’s harmful radiation thereby reducing the progression of skin aging. Antioxidants also help in the prevention and treatment of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging by acting as free radical scavengers thereby preventing the cells from damage.21 Treatment with antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols, tocopherols, and other natural substances helps to develop resistance to oxidative stress and slows down the process of skin aging.22 Phytochemicals such as resveratrol, quercetin, green tea extract have also been reported to be effective in reducing the progression of the aging process.23 Apart from these, topical treatment with cell regulators like vitamin A derivatives, polyphenols, and botanicals also helps in preventing aging. These act on collagen metabolism thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastic fibers.



[Strategies for anti-aging]
The proportion of the aged population is gradually on the rise owing to developments in healthcare and improvement in lifestyle, particularly in developed countries. With aging, some of the body functions get affected leading to a variety of diseases like a chronic coronary disease, hypertension, and diabetes.24 Increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals plays a vital role in the aging process.25 Aging is a process that affects all cells, tissues, organs, diminishing homeostasis and increasing organism vulnerability.26 Premature photoaged skin leads to the thickened epidermis, deep wrinkles, discoloration, roughness, and dullness.27 Further loss of skin elasticity leads to a phenomenon called sagging. This, in turn, leads to less effective desquamation and slower wound healing in older people. It is a fact that skin beauty is perceived as an important indicator signifying the overall well-being of an individual. Hence several anti-aging strategies are developed. Some of them are skin care, use of moisturizing preparations, botulinum toxin, hormone replacement therapy, antioxidants, photoprotection, and anti-wrinkling treatment.

As age progresses, the skin tends to become dry and scaly, especially in the elderly. So it becomes important to use a barrier to preserve this vital layer. Protection against dehydration, preventing the penetration of irritants, microorganisms, allergens, radiation, and protection against the reactive oxygen species requires a healthy and functioning skin barrier. Penetration via the skin can be regulated to allow selective penetration of substances which helps in skin regeneration, maintaining smoothness and elasticity.1 Degradation of primary structural components, i.e. elastin and collagen results in the formation of wrinkles. So, care should be taken by keeping the skin subtle and moist; this will help the skin look radiant and younger. Personal care products are available from many sources for this purpose.28 Some of the practices that can improve the skin conditions are drinking more water, eating healthier foods, reducing stress, using sunblock and exercising more. Another approach is the use of topical or systemic antioxidants which helps in the prevention of wrinkles by reducing inflammation. Some of the skin care approaches are discussed below.



[Strategies for anti-aging - Hormone replacement therapy]
Months after menopause, females experience a sudden onset of the symptoms of skin aging like dryness and a decrease in skin elasticity. The decrease in estrogen might thus reduce the skin functions which are in control of estrogen.29 Studies have shown that hypo-estrogenism affects the skin collagen. Skin collagen content varies according to age, and it declines in the years following menopause. Increase in skin collagen was found in people who underwent hormone replacement therapy.30 However, the evidence for the same is limited and hence remains to be controversial. In one of the studies, an increase in the levels of procollagen I and III messenger RNA and collagen I protein was observed in the sun protected aged hip skin in subjects treated with topical estradiol. However, surprisingly, no beneficial effects were observed when applied on photoaged forearm or face skin.31



[Strategies for anti-aging - Botulinum toxin]
Botulinum toxin (BTX) does not stop the aging process, but these BTX injections help in slowing down of the visible aging processes such as facial lines and wrinkles. Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injections are the most effective cosmetic procedures for reducing the appearance of facial lines caused by facial muscle contraction. BTX-A is one of the most effective approaches for wrinkles which form because of muscular contraction. It works by selectively blocking the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by binding to presynaptic nerve terminal and thereby it prevents muscle contraction. After this injection, improvements were found in about 1-14 days. BTX label recommends its use only for treating glabellar lines among adults below 65 years of age, however, it is still being used for different cosmetic purposes.32 BTX-A has the advantage that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier neither does it permeate through the skin. The dosing largely depends on the area, muscle mass and gender.1 Elders above 65 years of age are likely to have weaker facial muscle, less elastic skin and are hence not expected to respond well to this therapy.33 The use of botulinum toxin type A has rapidly increased over the years, and it has occupied a major portion in the cosmetic care market. Its use has become synonymous with wrinkle reduction and has formed the basis for the identification and synthesis of many other peptides which may have similar activity and are relatively safe as compared to botulinum toxins.34,35



[Strategies for anti-aging - Anti-wrinkling]
Wrinkles are mainly caused due to lack of elastic feature of the skin. A specific skin fibroblast elastase inhibitor can be used to prevent UVB induced wrinkle formation and thus help to maintain the linear configuration of elastic fibers and skin elasticity.20 Hyaluronic acid and botulinum toxin have also been widely used as anti-wrinkling agents.36



[Strategies for anti-aging - Moisturizing preparations]
Hyaluronic acid plays a principal role in the preservation of hydration and elasticity of the skin. Sericin gel also has moisturizing effect when applied on the skin. This may be attributed to the hydration of epidermal cell and an increase in hydroxyproline level. This aids in skin care and anti-aging effect of sericin.37



[Strategies for anti-aging - Antioxidants and photoprotection]
The primary strategy for prevention of photoaging is photoprotection, and the secondary treatment is by the use of exogenous antioxidants and other compounds that cannot be synthesized in our body. Polyphenols, a novel set of compounds have garnered widespread interests as effective anti-aging compounds possessing significant antioxidant properties. They prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species triggered by exogenous (UV radiations) and endogenous agents thereby inhibiting oxidative skin damage.8 Vitamin B3, C, and E which shows sufficient penetration into the skin form the most important antioxidant substances. Several other compounds like alpha lipoic acids, alpha hydroxyl acids in conjunction with vitamins have proved to be beneficial as antioxidants.38,39 Regular use of antioxidants such as vitamin A, C, E, etc. in the normal diet, may reduce the risk of UV induced skin damage. Antioxidants prevent oxidative stress and enhance DNA repair. Defense mechanisms by the cellular antioxidants help to prevent the damage caused by the oxidizing components of UV radiations.8 Antioxidants react with the superoxides and suppress the skin diseases caused by reactive oxygen species.19 The different types of free radical scavengers are superoxide dismutase, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc sulfate, green tea, ferulic acid, idebenone, polyphenols, and carotenoids.11 Several photoprotective agents are nothing but protective clothing, umbrellas, trees which acts as sunblock. Sunscreen which has several inorganic and organic filters also helps in photoprotection.40



[Sunscreens]
Sunscreen agents protect the skin by minimizing the damaging effects of harmful UV radiations from the sun. About 90 % of cases of skin cancer are associated with exposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays. UV radiation that irradiates the earth is absorbed by the ozone layer. Consequently, UVA and UVB reach the earth surface. UVA reaches the earth surface and contributes to premature skin aging and skin cancer, while, UVB causes sunburn. Of the UV radiations reaching the earth, UVB is responsible for most of the deleterious effects of solar exposure, but the damaging role of UVA has been greatly documented. Hence, new generation sunscreen which protects a whole range of UV radiation is recommended.41 Sunscreens are strongly recommended by many healthcare practitioners to minimize the harmful effects of UV rays on our skin.42 The most important reason behind the use of sunscreen is that it shields us from harmful UV rays, prevents premature aging, tanning, and sunburns, lowers blotchiness on the face, improves the health of the skin, and lowers the incidence of skin cancer.43 UVA rays upregulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase which degrades elastin and collagen, the two major components which maintain the rigidity of skin. Failure to protect from the harmful effects of UVA radiation may lead to loss of elasticity and lead to wrinkling of skin.44



[Sunscreens - Sunscreen ingredients/sunscreen filters]
The efficiency of the sunscreen depends on the type of UV filter which may be an organic or an inorganic UV filter.45 The sunscreen ingredients are broadly classified into two types viz, chemical or organic and physical or inorganic.46 Based on their mechanism of action, sunscreens are also traditionally divided into inorganic (physical) blockers and organic (chemical) absorbers.



[Sunscreens - Sunscreens and sunblocks]
Sunblocks are the products which protect against UVB rays while sunscreen protects against UVA rays. Sunblock comes under the physical category of protective lotion, containing both non-organic and organic constituents that get deposited on the surface of the skin when applied, shielding the skin from harmful UVB rays. These block the rays from penetrating the skin. Some of the ingredients found in sunblock are octocrylene, octyl salicylate, and octyl methoxycinnamate. The chemical type of protective lotions can be broadly referred to as sunscreens. This lotion permeates through the skin and absorbs the UVA rays before they can reach and damage the dermal layer. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide constitute the sunscreen. Ecamsule is one of the ingredients present in sunscreen. This compound shields the skin from the photoaging UVA rays. A formulation which constitutes both sunscreen and sunblock ingredients serves as a protective agent against both UVB and UVA rays, and a combination of these two is more efficient in the protection of the skin than using them alone.51

When sunscreen is applied as recommended, it tends to reduce only 55% of the free radical formation. However, antioxidants in sunscreen are capable of reducing greater amount of free radicals than the use of sunscreen alone.52 Formulation of sunscreen containing antioxidant faces certain challenges such as ensuring the stability of antioxidants in the final formulation. A challenging task in the formulation of these products is that the antioxidant needs to penetrate into the epidermis whereas the UV filters need to remain on the surface of the skin to exert its effect. Hence, a careful modulation of the formulation is essential to maintain a balance between both the properties of the product. Even though our body has an internal antioxidant defense mechanism to neutralize reactive oxygen species, this defense mechanism might get depleted during excessive oxidative stress. Here the topical administration of the antioxidants might help to reduce the reactive oxygen species. So these antioxidants provide additional benefits to the sunscreen formulations and skin care products.53



[Anti-aging and sunscreens]
Broad spectrum sunscreens protect the skin from aging as well as harmful UV rays. Some products also claim protection against free radicals.54 Some of the products that show both properties are listed in Table 1.

There has been a lot of research conducted on anti-aging and sunscreen products to enhance its efficacy, stability, safety and be more favorable to consumers. Some of the literatures available are discussed below.

Lewicka et al63 isolated TiO2 and ZnO particles by several extraction processes and examined its shape, dimension, crystal phase, surface area, and elemental composition. These TiO2 and ZnO pigments exhibited two different sizes and forms. TiO2 pigment showed needle or nearly spherical shape and was smaller whereas ZnO pigment showed rod-like shape appearance and was much larger. The surface area of ZnO was found to be less than TiO2. The dimension of TiO2 was about 25 nm, and ZnO had short axis less than 40 nm and longer dimension greater than 100 nm. TEM helped to isolate and determine the primary pigment dimensions. This study compared the characters of the extracted sunscreen pigments with the commercially available nanomaterials, and two sources (T-Eco and Z-Cote) were identified which were similar to commercially obtained sunscreen materials. Elemental analysis showed that the sunscreen pigments contained aluminium and silicon and were similar to T-Eco and Z-Cote which had no additional inorganic elements. These aluminium and silicon were used as coating materials on TiO2 to reduce its UV photoactivity and restrict the reactive oxygen species production. This data would be helpful in studying the impact of engineered nanomaterials in sunscreen on the health of individuals and the environment.

Yenilmez et al64 formulated vitamin E incorporated chitosan (CS) microspheres for cosmetic purposes. This vitamin E incorporated CS microspheres were prepared and evaluated for various characteristics such as particle size, size distribution, zeta potential, and polymeric lattice structure. Vitamin E as such is not used widely in the cosmetic preparations because of its low stability, but vitamin E in CS microspheres proved to be relatively stable. When vitamin E was incorporated in CS microspheres, it showed enhanced cationic character of particles which resulted in enhanced topical penetration. The polymeric lattice of pure CS was in amorphous state and even after incorporation of vitamin E there was no change in the structure of particles. Incorporation efficiency of the vitamin E in CS microspheres was found to be 78.40 ± 2.41% (w/w). In vitro studies showed that vitamin E release from CS microsphere was 89.1% at the end of 6 hours. DPPH tests showed that this formulation had an antioxidant effect. In vivo efficiency tests of vitamin E formulation showed an increase in skin elasticity and moisture without a change in skin pH and sebum values, proving to be an effective anti-aging product.

Topical peptides have also been explored as a possible anti-aging strategy. Lim et al studied the enhanced penetration of Argireline®, a synthetic acetyl hexapeptide as a plausible compound for reducing the wrinkles associated with aging. Four peptide analogs which were chemically modified were investigated for its increased penetration ability. The wrinkle reducing effect of the peptides were also compared using human dental pulp stem cells. The peptides were dissolved in propylene glycol and water mixture to evaluate its permeation. The modified peptides were found to show an enhanced penetration and anti-wrinkling potential as compared to the parent compound.65,66

The effect of modulation of gene expression instigated by Aframomum angustifolium seed extract was evaluated as a possible anti-aging strategy by Talbourdet et al. The efficacy of the extracts was evaluated on normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) and human fibroblasts (NHFs). The expressions of antioxidant genes namely metallothionein 1, metallothionein 2, and thioredoxin were increased in NHKs, while expressions of glutathione peroxidase were increased in NHFs. On evaluating the efficacy of the skin care product containing the seed extract, a significant improvement in the homogeneity of the skin was observed. This suggests the potential of the seed extract as a possible gene expression modulator and its effect on the skin rejuvenation as a promising anti-wrinkling agent.67

Increasing age is often associated with a decrease in the stem cell production. They form the building blocks for regeneration. Presence of stem cells will help in repairing damaged areas by secretion of growth factors which can act as a potential strategy for skin therapeutics.68 Sych et al evaluated the potential for the use of fetal stem cells (FSCs) as an anti-aging strategy. Studies were conducted on 126 subjects which revealed that FSCs were found to be safe and efficacious for rejuvenation therapy.69 These results proved that stem cells could be a promising alternative to the currently available anti-aging products.

Fu et al. conducted a randomized trial on 196 women to evaluate the efficacy of a cosmetic product containing 5% niacinamide, peptides and 0.3 % retinyl propionate in comparison to the commercially available tretinoin as a potential anti-wrinkling agent. The results revealed a remarkable improvement in the fine lines and wrinkle appearance after 8 weeks when compared to that of prescription product, tretinoin.70



[Nanoparticles in anti-aging and sunscreens]
Nanoparticles have been explored for its use in delivering a variety of cosmeceuticals. Conventional delivery systems have been replaced with novel nanocarriers like liposomes, niosomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, nanoemulsion, etc. Their stability, high entrapment efficiency, controlled release of the actives and enhanced skin penetration make it advantageous over the conventional counterparts. A plethora of literature is available on the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system for anti-aging and sunscreen effects. Heydari et al prepared nanoethosomal delivery system of gamma oryzanol for dermal delivery to prevent skin aging. The effect of the formulation on the skin wrinkle improvement was studied by dermoscopic and histological examination on healthy humans and rats. The results of histopathological studies revealed an improved antioxidant activity of the nanoethosomal formulation as compared to the plain gel. Positive results with respect to its photo protective effect were confirmed from dermoscopic studies.71

The photoprotective and antioxidant effects of naringenin were studied by formulating them into polymeric nanoparticles. The in vitro skin permeation studies revealed an increased deposition of naringenin in the skin rather than permeation into the deeper layers. The formulation also exhibited significant antioxidant effect with limited dermal toxicity. This suggests that the nanoparticulate formulation may behave as a potential antioxidant and sunscreen agent.72

Transferosomes loaded with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and hyaluronic acid were developed by Avadhani et al to enhance their sun protective activity along with their antioxidant and anti-aging effects. The developed nanoparticles showed promising free-radical scavenging and were able to suppress ROS and MDA levels when evaluated in human keratinocytes. An enhanced penetration and deposition of EGCG were found in the skin when given with hyaluronic acid.73 Shetty et al developed a novel sunscreen formulation containing morin which showed positive in vitro free radical scavenging properties. The nanoparticles were further incorporated into creams containing zinc oxide and nano titanium dioxide which showed optimum sun protection factor of ~40. In vivo studies on UV exposed rats revealed excellent antioxidant effects with least toxicity.6

To reduce irritation potential and to prolong the duration of action and increase the loading capacity of tretinoin (a vitamin A derivative), Ghate et al formulated nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The NLCs were then incorporated into carbopol gel for the ease of application. On evaluating it’s in vitro release profile, a sustained release pattern was observed when compared to the marketed product. In vivo skin irritation studies showed minimal skin irritation with the developed formulations in comparison to marketed tretinoin gel.74

Ammar et al developed folic acid loaded nanostructured carriers to enable its controlled delivery for an anti-aging effect. The NLCs were fabricated using the hot high-pressure homogenization technique. The optimized nanoparticles were evaluated for their in vitro release, ex vivo skin permeation and antioxidant properties. About 95% of folic acid was found to be encapsulated within the lipid matrix. On determining its skin deposition ability, the results showed a promising accumulation within the skin revealing a depot effect. The developed formulations also showed a significant hydration and free radical scavenging potential suggesting the possibility of using this formulation as a potential anti-aging formulation.75

The protective effect of rice bran oil against UVB induced skin injury in mice when encapsulated within a lipid core nanocapsule was evaluated by Rigo et al. Nanocapsules were prepared using poly(ε-caprolactone) and span 60 which were later incorporated into hydrogels made of carbopol as gel base. The efficacy of the formulation was tested in UVB induced skin injury in mice. The in vivo results showed a promising protective and antioxidant effect of rice bran oil when encapsulated within nanocapsules as compared to rice bran oil alone. This technology suggests the critical role of nanoparticles as delivery carriers for the treatment of skin injuries triggered by UV radiations.76



[Patents on anti-aging and sunscreens]
Due to the widespread market value of the anti-aging and sunscreen products, constant developments are being made to come out with new formulations for the same. Many patents have been filed by researchers, a few of which have been compiled in this section.

Gershon et al77 formulated sunscreen preparation containing zinc oxide (ZnO) particles. The particle size of ZnO was tailored in such a way that they were within the maximum threshold of 80 nm and a minimum threshold of 30 nm. ZnO has the ability to absorb UV radiation and protect the skin from further damage. These particles were further coated with the optical coating material and suspended in a suitable media which was selected based on its refractive index. Two or more media were combined together to achieve the desired refractive index between 1 and 2. Integration of the multiple zinc oxide particles was performed by dispersing it in the first medium and applying the second medium on the top. The multiple manipulated zinc oxide particles were optically coated which contains silicon dioxide. Each of these optically coated multiple zinc oxide particles undergoes aggregation and forms one or more clusters of size greater than 200 nm. In these clusters, the multiple zinc oxide particles create optical separation. The aggregates comprise one or more binding agent with one or more nanospheres.

Alexiades-Armenakas78 developed cosmetic preparation containing active ingredients to fight various signs of skin aging such as wrinkles, age spots, reduction in redness, acne, and rosacea. This single anti-aging skin care formulation contained 37 different microencapsulated ingredients which are protected from surrounding ingredients and also penetrates deeper strata of skin. The cream consisted of multiple ingredients along with a polymer base. The ingredients were selected based on their safety and efficacy, and belonged to the following categories, viz, DNA and cellular repair, anti-wrinkle, anti-redness and anti-pigmentation, antioxidant, anti UV damage, barrier repair, moisturizer, pro-collagen and an ingredient which prevents abnormal skin lesions. The ingredients having DNA repair and anti UV damage properties, procollagen were encapsulated in liposomes which contained soy lecithin to target epidermis. Cationic liposomes were chosen to ensure intercellular delivery of antioxidants including vitamin C and E for deeper penetration into the dermis layer. The liposomes consisted of an edge activator, sodium deoxycholate which helps in barrier repair and acts as an emollient.

Armand79 formulated an anti-aging cream containing equal mixture high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides. Water-based hyaluronan was prepared to repair and prevent skin aging by preventing transepidermal water loss, damage to skin elastic fibers. This mixture of hyaluronan helps in the production of new collagen, skin keratinocytes, and extracellular matrix components. Low molecular weight hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides were prepared by hydrolyzing high molecular weight hyaluronic acid with testicular hyaluronidase, followed by its purification using ion-exchange resins. The obtained oligosaccharides were chemically deacetylated and mixed with an equal amount of high molecular weight hyaluronan in the final formulation. The penetrability of the formulation into the dermis was assessed using artificial skin and nude mice using isothiocyanatofluorescein coupled hyaluronan oligosaccharides.

Zahner80 formulated a topical sunscreen lotion containing ingredients in its natural state. This natural sunscreen with an aqueous phase had the composition as follows: melanin, green tea extract with a polyphenol, mineral pigments of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. This all natural sunscreen lotion was formulated with the active ingredients such that it would provide desired SPF, protection of cell from free radicals and level of water resistance. The green tea polyphenols possess synergistic photoprotective effects on skin when combined with TiO2and ZnO and are effective in reducing erythema. Melanin present in the formulation is a superior free radical trap, and it is also capable of regenerating the neutralized polyphenols of green tea. The mineral pigments, TiO2 and ZnO, are said to be active UVA/UVB reflecting sunscreen ingredients which provide UVB protection of 75% for SPF 4, 88% for SPF 8 and 93% for SPF 15. These mineral sunscreens are left untreated such that this sunscreen composition remains in all natural state.



[Toxicity aspects]
There are certain ingredients in the sunscreen that might cause hormonal changes in the body. Oxybenzone is an organic filter which absorbs UV radiations especially UVB radiation, and it is systemically absorbed and excreted in urine and feces.81 Oxybenzone is one such ingredient which affects the estrogenic levels in the body, and it has the highest rate of photoallergy among other UV filters.45 However, it was speculated that this effect could only be seen in individuals who would use the product continuously for a longer period for about 35-277 years.54 Nanoparticles can also cause local and systemic toxicity. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are reduced to nanosized particles so there is a great concern that these particles would penetrate the skin and produce UV induced free radicals.81 Continuous use of the sunscreen will prevent the exposure of the skin to UVB radiations thus there would be insufficient vitamin D synthesis in our body. Thus the individuals might not acquire the normal vitamin D levels which are required by the body. The dietary supplement would help to maintain the normal vitamin D levels in our body.45 Some chemical ingredients in sunscreen might cause edema, erythema, and irritation.82 To increase the patient compliance, several sunscreens have preservatives, fragrances, and other excipients which might induce allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Patients with photodermatitis are likely to develop photo contact dermatitis to sunscreen.83 Sunscreens containing p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) help to protect from UVB rays and is said to be water resistant.42 But in vitro studies have shown that PABA interacts with DNA followed by UV radiations and might cause photocarcinogenesis.48 Hence a careful selection of sunscreen is vital to reap its benefits.



[Regulatory requirements/guidelines]
As per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laws, cosmetics products do not require pre-market approval from FDA. Nevertheless, these products are regulated by certain laws put forth by FDA.84 However, if these cosmetics contain any ingredients which may alter the body function, these are categorized as ‘drug’ as per Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C). It is the responsibility of the company which manufactures these products to ensure the safety of such products.85



[Regulatory requirements/guidelines - Labeling information on sunscreen products]
Some of the points which have to be displayed on the sunscreen label along with its explanation have been detailed below:

Broad spectrum: The label should specify if the sunscreen is a broad spectrum one. Sunscreens which are labeled as broad-spectrum protect our skin from both UVB and UVA rays. For a sunscreen to be broad spectrum it has to pass FDA broad spectrum test that measures the transmittance or absorbance of ultraviolet radiations across both UVA and UVB regions of the spectrum.86

SPF: SPF is an important claim to be specified on the sunscreen products. SPF gives a measure of UVB rays involved in burning and not UVA rays involved in ageing.21 An SPF of 15 is expected to protect the skin from harmful UV rays for about 150 minutes.87 The levels of protection from different SPF rates are: SPF15 provides 93% of protection from UVB rays, SPF30 provides 97% of protection from UVB rays, and SPF50 provides 98% of protection from UVB rays (Figure 2).88,89

Thus we can conclude that SPF30 gives only 4% more protection and SPF50, about 5% more protection than SPF15.88 So it is a misapprehension that higher SPF can give more protection than that with a lower one.90

Water resistance: The sunscreen that claims to be water resistant should be reapplied for every 40 to 80 minutes which helps to provide protection while swimming and sweating.91

Shelf life: According to FDA, the shelf life of the sunscreen should be at least three years. The sunscreen products which does not have an expiry date mentioned on it clearly indicates that the shelf life of the product is three years.86 However, storage conditions can render the product unstable. Extreme temperatures also make the sunscreens less effective despite its expiration date.51



[Conclusion and future prospects]
Although the sun is beneﬁcial and essential for life, exposing ourselves too much to sunlight might lead to detrimental health effects such as skin cancer. Studies and research have been conducted to introduce sunscreen in the form of pills for oral administration instead of reapplying the topical sunscreen repeatedly. Research and development are constantly underway to ensure that the sunscreen products are more effective and lessen the risk of adverse effects. Nanotechnology platforms have proved to be a major part of the cosmeceutical market owing to its better anti-aging and sunscreen potential which also renders a better skin deposition property and stability to the formulations. There has been ongoing research for the use of photosynthetic microorganisms in sunscreens especially cyanobacteria which has great potential in protecting our skin from damaging UV radiation and intense sunlight. Such biological compounds have many potential advantages over current synthetically derived sunscreens. The synthetic compounds are being gradually replaced with natural compounds as the new source of protective agents owing to their better efficacy and safety.

TITLE: False memory in normal ageing: empirical data from the DRM paradigm and theoretical perspectives

ABSTRACT: False memories refer to falsely remembering something that did not happen or that happened differently. The effects of age on episodic memory underlie both the decline in real memories and the increase in false memories. But, what is the richness and what is the feeling of reality of false memories in the elderly? This mini-review on false memory in young and older adults presents the results from the literature using one of the most used paradigms in the laboratory to study false memories - the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. This paradigm generally consists in the presentation of semantically associated items-lists (words or images) related to a non-presented critical lure (e.g., bed, rest, awake …, the critical lure is sleep). During free recall or recognition tests, the participants regularly produce false memories (intrusions or false recognitions of the critical lures), increasingly with aging. We specifically ask the question of the richness of the false memory trace in young and older adults in terms of contextual associations (What-Where-When-Details binding) and phenomenological characteristics (remembering, knowing, guessing). We propose to examine this issue using a naturalistic episodic memory task via navigation in a virtual environment enriched with series of associated elements (e.g., vegetables stand) linked to non-presented critical lures (e.g., carrots). Based on preliminary results, we propose an integrative model of memory trace which can explain the differences observed between young and old people on the richness of their false memories.

TITLE: The voice of healthy aging for changing paradigms and changing lives: a tribute to Dr. Enrique Vega García

ABSTRACT: None

FULL TEXT:

[A VISIONARY BEYOND HIS TIME]
Dr. Vega García believed that aging was not a problem to be solved, but a natural process to be understood, embraced and supported. He persistently advocated for a shift in how we feel, think and act about aging. This belief was not merely rhetorical; it served as the foundation for his policy work, educational efforts and research. His holistic approach acknowledged the biological, psychological, social and cultural dimensions of aging: promoting active participation, autonomy and dignity for all older adults.



[PIONEERING CONTRIBUTIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH, GERIATRICS AND AGING]
Dr. Vega García’s work at PAHO marked a turning point in how aging was framed within public health agendas. He led groundbreaking initiatives integrating chronic disease prevention, long-term care and healthy aging strategies across countries. Under his leadership, aging became an integral part of life-course approaches, evidence-based policies and intersectoral action. He championed the innovative use of demographic and health data to reveal the often-overlooked challenges of aging. He conducted and promoted rigorous studies of the social determinants of health in old age, the prevention and management of chronic diseases, and the quality of life of older populations. A strong advocate for translational research, he ensured that scientific knowledge was converted into practical interventions that reached those who needed them most, redefining the relationship between evidence and action in the field of aging. He was also among the first public health leaders in the Region to recognize the potentials of digital health and artificial intelligence to improve the lives of older people. He understood that technology, when used ethically and inclusively, could reduce barriers to care, support autonomy and independence, and enhance well-being in later life. His forward-looking approach helped lay the foundation for integrating digital tools into aging and health strategies across the Region of the Americas.



[CHANGING PARADIGMS, CHANGING LIVES]
Dr. Vega García catalyzed cultural and institutional shifts in how aging is perceived. He moved the field away from fragmented, disease-centered models towards inclusive, person-centered approaches focusing on functional ability and enabling people to do what they have reason to value. He reminded us that to serve older people well, we must create health systems, environments and societies that value their contributions, honor their stories and enable their full participation in social life. His oft-repeated phrase that “First, we need to change the way we feel, think and act about old age and aging,” stands as a call to action across the Region. It captures his most enduring legacy: the re-humanization of aging in policy, in research and in practice.



[HUMANITARIANISM, MENTORSHIP AND ETHICAL LEADERSHIP]
Dr. Vega García’s work was guided by a profound humanity that transcended his professional achievements. He understood aging not merely as a subject of study, but as a deeply personal and social matter. He often reminded colleagues that numbers and indicators should never eclipse the lived experiences of older people. Every initiative he led was grounded in compassion, equity and high respect for human dignity. He was a vocal advocate for the human rights of older persons and contributed to advancing Regional commitments, such as the Inter-American Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons. His empathy extended far beyond formal settings. In a conversation with a friend who had just turned 55 and was concerned about health issues, Dr. Vega García said with characteristic clarity and warmth: “Bro, hay que entender que después de los 50 todos estamos enfermos de algo; la cosa es llevarlo bien y disfrutar al máximo la vida controlando lo que tenemos” [“Bro, we have to realize that after 50 we’re all affected by something. The thing is to manage it the best we can and enjoy life to the fullest.”].

This simple but profound reflection embodied his philosophy: accept aging with honesty, manage it with responsibility and live it with joy. He also played a key role in mentoring future generations of public health professionals. For him, capacity-building was not just about transferring knowledge, it was about modeling values: empathy, critical thinking, public service. His presence in classrooms, at conferences and in communities left an indelible mark on countless students, colleagues and collaborators.



[A LASTING LEGACY]
Dr. Enrique Vega García’s work continues to shape public health strategies across the Region of the Americas and beyond. His influence helped embed healthy aging into national health agendas, train thousands of professionals, and empower new generations and communities to engage with their older members with dignity and respect. His integrative vision—linking health across the life course with an ethical commitment to equity—offers a model for modern public health. He recognized that aging could not be addressed in isolation and instead wove it into broader efforts, from childhood development to chronic disease prevention, digital transformation and to human rights.

Through this work, he catalyzed intergenerational thinking and multisectoral collaboration, ensuring that the policies he championed were not only innovative but also inclusive and sustainable. His legacy is a reminder that the future of healthy aging depends on our ability to connect the dots across disciplines, generations, and systems, with foresight, empathy and unwavering respect for human dignity.

Dr. Vega García’s legacy teaches us that transformations in health begin with transformations in mindsets. His work was grounded in scientific excellence and ethical responsibility, driven by a vision of a world where aging is no longer synonymous with vulnerability but with opportunity. This editorial stands as a tribute and a promise: to keep alive the values he embodied, to advance the causes he championed, and to ensure that every step we take toward better healthy aging policies and practices carries his spirit—committed, courageous and compassionate.

In memory of a true leader in public health and a tireless advocate for older people: Enrique! Your voice, your values and your vision live on.
