  "title": "d-Galactose-induced accelerated aging model: an overview",
  "abstract": "To facilitate the process of aging healthily and prevent age-related health problems, efforts to properly understand aging mechanisms and develop effective and affordable anti-aging interventions are deemed necessary. Systemic administration of D-galactose has been established to artificially induce senescence in vitro and in vivo as well as for anti-aging therapeutic interventions studies. The aim of this article is to comprehensively discuss the use of D-galactose to generate a model of accelerated aging and its possible underlying mechanisms involved in different tissues/organs.",
