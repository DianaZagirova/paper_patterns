  "title": "The Aging Athlete: Paradigm of Healthy Aging",
  "abstract": "The Exercise Boom of the 1970's resulted in the adoption of habitual exercise in a significant portion of the population. Many of these individuals are defying the cultural norms by remaining physically active and competing at a high level in their later years. The juxtaposition between masters athletes and non-exercisers demonstrate the importance of remaining physically active throughout the lifespan on physiological systems related to healthspan (years of healthy living). This includes ~50% improved maximal aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and enhanced skeletal muscle health (size, function, as well as metabolic and communicative properties) compared to non-exercisers at a similar age. By taking a reductionist approach to VO<sub>2</sub>max and skeletal muscle health, we can gain insight into how aging and habitual exercise affects the aging process. Collectively, this review provides a physiological basis for the elite performances seen in masters athletes, as well as the health implications of lifelong exercise with a focus on VO<sub>2</sub>max, skeletal muscle metabolic fitness, whole muscle size and function, single muscle fiber physiology, and communicative properties of skeletal muscle. This review has significant public health implications due to the potent health benefits of habitual exercise across the lifespan.",
