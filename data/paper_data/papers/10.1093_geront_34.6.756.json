  "title": "Re-engaging the Disengagement Theory of Aging: On the History and Assessment of Theory Development in Gerontology",
  "abstract": "While \"disengagement theory\" is today largely discounted, it has an important place in the history of gerontological explanation. First we analyze the historical context of this theory. Second, we examine its long-term contributions and deficiencies in terms of finer criteria--standards which we suggest should be used in evaluating current, and future, theories in social gerontology.",
