## Response
Below is a generalized, data-driven synthesis based on the provided positive (golden) and negative paper sets and the supplied ground-truth description of “aging theory.” All patterns and rules are induced from the samples and the ground-truth definition; where relevant, I cite specific examples by DOI and/or index.

1) TRUE CHARACTERISTICS: features that reliably indicate genuine aging theory papers

Purpose and level of explanation
- Primary aim is explanatory, not merely descriptive or applied: papers propose, articulate, refine, or critically examine an overarching framework for why and/or how senescence occurs in biological organisms (ultimate evolutionary causes and/or proximate mechanistic causes).
  - Examples:
    - Ultimate/evolutionary emphasis: Wensink & Cohen’s Danaid theory argues inherent unmaintainability as a driver across taxa (10.3389/fcell.2021.671208, idx 7); Mc Auley reviews classic and emerging evolutionary theories (10.1007/s10522-024-10143-5, idx 12).
    - Proximate/mechanistic emphasis: “Redox theory of aging” (10.1042/CS20160897, idx 6); “Free Radical Theory of Aging” reviews (10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547, idx 13; 10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00317-8, idx 4); “Mitochondrial free radical theory” (10.1016/B978-0-12-394625-6.00001-5, idx 23); “Information Theory of Aging” (10.1038/s43587-023-00527-6, idx 9); “Brain–body energy conservation (BEC) model” with organism-level predictions (10.1038/s43587-024-00716-x, idx 22).

Breadth and generality (species/taxa; multiple systems)
- Theory is intended to generalize within a species (universality) and often across species, addressing senescence as a species-wide process, not limited to one organ or disease.
  - Examples: Atwood & Bowen’s reproductive–cell cycle theory applies to “all sexually reproductive life forms” (10.1016/j.exger.2010.09.007, idx 1). Barja, Beckman & Ames, and Cadenas link mitochondria/ROS to broad, cross-species phenomena (idx 23, 13, 4). Mc Auley (idx 12) and de Magalhães (10.1038/s41556-025-01698-7, idx 3) survey theories across clades and contexts.

Explicit positioning within or against recognized theory families
- Authors connect their framework to classical evolutionary theories or well-known mechanistic paradigms and/or propose explicit updates, syntheses, or alternatives.
  - Examples: “Telomere Erosion in Disposable Soma” integrates telomere loss with Kirkwood’s DS (10.1182/blood.2021014299, idx 2). Gems explicitly synthesizes antagonistic pleiotropy with programmatic/hyperfunction mechanisms (10.1016/j.arr.2021.101557, idx 19). Reviews of theory families (idx 3, 12) make the theoretical scope explicit.

Causal claims about senescence (intrinsic, progressive, deleterious)
- The proposed mechanisms are intrinsic (endogenous) and aim to explain progressive, deleterious changes that increase mortality risk—i.e., senescence itself (not only age-associated diseases).
  - Examples: Redox theory (idx 6) reframes endogenous redox network remodeling across the lifespan; tumor suppression theory (10.1016/j.mad.2021.111583, idx 5) posits somatic mutation/tumor-suppressive mechanisms as central drivers of senescence; information theory (idx 9) posits loss of youthful epigenetic information as a primary causal axis.

Testable, integrative, or predictive structure
- Either provides testable predictions, integrates disparate observations under one framework, or uses theory-guided modeling to explain lifespan/senescence patterns at organismal scale.
  - Examples: Entropy-generation work linking CR/PR to lifespan trajectories (10.1073/pnas.2300624120, idx 10) grounds predictions in thermodynamics and broadly interprets Schrodinger’s hypothesis at organism scale. Complex-systems theory frames physiological dysregulation as emergent, organism-level senescence (10.1007/s10522-015-9584-x, idx 16; 10.1038/s43587-022-00252-6, idx 14).

Theory-centric discourse markers
- Frequent use of conceptual language: theory, framework, proposes/posits, ultimate/proximate, unifying/explanatory, evolutionary logic, general mechanism; frequent engagement with prior theories (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood, etc.).
  - Clear in idx 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 19, 23, 24.

Publication types consistent with theory
- Reviews, perspectives, syntheses, and conceptual original research. Presence of “Aging” [Majr] common but not sufficient; explicit theoretical framing matters.
  - Examples: theory reviews (idx 3, 12, 13, 14, 19, 23), theory proposals with data (idx 2, 10, 22), theory updates (idx 1, 6).

Note: Some provided positives are social gerontology theories (e.g., disengagement theory, continuity theory; idx 11, 15). These are indeed “theories of aging” but not biological mechanisms of senescence; they explain psychosocial patterns in later life. For biological-aging classification, they should be labeled separately (see Classification Rules).


2) FALSE POSITIVES CHARACTERISTICS: patterns that can mislead classification

Narrow scope (organ, tissue, disease, or context-specific) without general senescence claims
- Papers focus on a single organ system, cell type, disease category, or niche biology; they may use “theory” or “model,” but do not explain senescence as a general organismal process.
  - Examples:
    - “Seed-and-soil theory for blood ageing” (commentary on bone marrow niche signals; 10.1038/s41556-022-01062-z, idx 10).
    - “Iron homeostasis limits stemness/tumorigenesis” in lung (10.1038/s41586-024-08285-0, idx 13).
    - “Facial aging” in plastic surgery (10.1097/GOX.0b013e31828ed1da, idx 18).

Applied, clinical, public health, or “healthy aging” paradigms (not theories of senescence)
- These are about aging experience/management, resilience, functional status, or policy—valuable, but not theories of why/how senescence arises biologically.
  - Examples: “Active aging”/compression of morbidity (10.1155/2012/420637, idx 16); “Healthy ageing, resilience and wellbeing” (10.1017/S2045796017000324, idx 7); “The aging athlete” (10.1055/a-1761-8481, idx 20); “Subjective wellbeing, health, and ageing” (10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61489-0, idx 22); HIV and aging paradigm (10.1007/s11904-010-0041-9, idx 23).

Methodological or measurement-focused papers (not causal theories of senescence)
- Work on biomarkers, clocks, uncertainty quantification, dual-task paradigms, etc., that do not propose general causes of senescence.
  - Examples: epigenetic clock uncertainty (10.1111/acel.14283, idx 17); walking-while-talking gait studies (10.1016/j.gaitpost.2014.05.062, idx 6).

Mathematical/mortality models lacking explicit biological mechanism for senescence
- Generic models that reproduce Gompertz-like patterns without proposing biological/evolutionary causes of senescence across organisms.
  - Example: queue-based damage model yielding exponential mortality (10.1371/journal.pone.0233384, idx 1).

Cosmetic/consumer “anti-aging” or skin photoaging
- Focus on dermatology, sunscreens, aesthetics, product development—outside senescence theory.
  - Example: “Anti-aging and Sunscreens” (10.15171/apb.2019.042, idx 11).

Humanities/social theories of aging (non-biological)
- Cultural or humanities theories using “theory” but not addressing biological senescence mechanisms.
  - Example: “Aging as Adaptation” (10.1093/geront/gnad049, idx 14).

These categories “look like” theory because they use theory/model language, address aging-related topics, or review mechanisms. However, they do not advance a general, organism-level explanatory account of why/how senescence occurs.


3) EDGE CASES: challenging examples and why

- Thermodynamic/entropy vs. stochastic-damage models
  - PNAS 2023 (10.1073/pnas.2300624120, idx 10) ties entropy generation to lifespan responses to CR versus PR at the organism level, explicitly testing theoretical predictions; the paper sits squarely in theory-guided mechanistic inference and was included as positive.
  - PLOS ONE 2020 (10.1371/journal.pone.0233384, idx 1) offers a generic queue model that recovers Gompertz mortality but does not articulate a biological mechanism or evolutionary rationale for senescence; it is a modeling paper, not an aging theory.

- Complex systems framing
  - Cohen 2015 (10.1007/s10522-015-9584-x, idx 16) substantiates organism-level emergent dysregulation and proposes generalizable mechanisms (EPPs, dysregulation) relevant to senescence—fits theory.
  - Editorial 2024 on complex systems potential (10.1093/gerona/glae210, idx 19) is a perspective on methods and paradigm; it does not itself propose a theory—just outside.

- Social gerontology vs biological theory
  - Disengagement/continuity theories (idx 11, 15) are aging theories in social/psychological domains, not biological senescence. They should be handled distinctly to avoid conflation in biological searches.

- Tissue-focused mechanistic insights
  - Commentaries or single-organ mechanistic papers (e.g., marrow niche “seed-and-soil”; idx 10 negative; iron and lung stemness; idx 13 negative) are mechanistically rich but not general senescence theories; they are easy false positives if screening only for “theory” + “aging.”


4) THEORY DEFINITION: precise, unambiguous description (with clear separation from “model”)

Definition: Theory of Biological Aging (Senescence)
- A theory of biological aging is a logically organized, general explanatory framework that specifies the fundamental endogenous causes of senescence (the progressive, deleterious decline in physiological function that increases the probability of death) in a species, and often aims to generalize across taxa. It addresses either:
  - Ultimate (evolutionary) causes: why senescence exists and evolves (e.g., declining force of selection with age; antagonistic pleiotropy; mutation accumulation; disposable soma; developmental/quasi-program concepts).
  - Proximate (mechanistic) causes: how specific intrinsic molecular, cellular, tissue, or system-level processes generate progressive functional decline (e.g., redox network remodeling, mitochondrial ROS damage, telomere erosion, epigenetic information loss, hyperfunction, organism-level energy allocation/constraints, complex-systems dysregulation).
- A valid theory of biological aging:
  - Explains senescence as an intrinsic property of the organism (causes are endogenous; external factors can modulate).
  - Addresses progressive and deleterious changes that are species-typical (within-species universality; allows variation in rate/pattern).
  - Is general in scope (goes beyond a single disease, organ, or context).
  - Generates testable implications/predictions and/or integrates diverse observations coherently.

Scope clarifications
- Theories can be:
  - Evolutionary (ultimate), Mechanistic (proximate), or Integrative (explicitly linking ultimate and proximate).
  - Program-based, damage/error-based, constraint-based, complex-systems based, or hybrids (as in idx 19, 6, 16, 22).
- Theories may be proposed via reviews, perspectives, conceptual analyses, or original research anchored in a general explanatory framework.

Distinction from related concepts
- Model of aging: a formal representation (mathematical/computational/diagrammatic) of specific processes or consequences under a theory’s assumptions. A model can explore feasibility, fit data, or generate predictions but, by itself, does not constitute a general explanation for why/how senescence exists. Example: a queue model reproducing Gompertz mortality without specifying biological causes is a model, not a theory (10.1371/journal.pone.0233384, idx 1).
- Hypothesis: a specific, testable proposition, often narrower than a theory. A theory can contain multiple hypotheses.
- Framework/perspective: may present organizing principles or research directions. It qualifies as a theory only if it specifies general causal mechanisms of senescence as above.
- Social theories of aging: valid “aging theories” within social/psychological domains (e.g., disengagement, continuity), but distinct from biological theories explaining senescence mechanisms.

Exclusions for “theory of biological aging”
- Papers focused solely on:
  - A single disease, organ, or tissue without an explicit claim to general senescence causation.
  - Public health, healthy aging, resilience, wellbeing, care delivery, or policy paradigms.
  - Measurement/biomarkers/methods (e.g., aging clocks) without proposing general causal mechanisms of senescence.
  - Cosmetic/skin “anti-aging.”


5) SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed retrieval to maximize recall and precision

Overview
- Use a two-stage strategy: high-recall queries to capture candidates, then precision filters and post-retrieval screening (rule-based + ML/LLM).

Stage A: High-recall core queries (Title/Abstract and MeSH)
- Query A1 (theory-centric biological terms):
  ("aging"[tiab] OR "ageing"[tiab] OR "senescence"[tiab] OR "longevity"[tiab]) AND
  (theor*[tiab] OR hypothes*[tiab] OR framework*[tiab] OR paradigm*[tiab] OR "ultimate cause"[tiab] OR "proximate cause"[tiab] OR "evolution*"[tiab])
  AND (("Aging"[Majr]) OR ("Cellular Senescence"[Majr]) OR ("Aging/physiology"[Majr]))
- Query A2 (canonical theory names in Title/Abstract):
  ("free radical"[tiab] OR "oxidative stress"[tiab] OR "redox"[tiab] OR "mitochondrial"[tiab] OR "telomere"[tiab] OR "antagonistic pleiotropy"[tiab] OR "mutation accumulation"[tiab] OR "disposable soma"[tiab] OR "hyperfunction"[tiab] OR "developmental theory"[tiab] OR "information theory"[tiab] OR "entropy"[tiab] OR "thermodynamic*"[tiab] OR "complex system*"[tiab] OR "physiological dysregulation"[tiab])
  AND ("aging"[tiab] OR "ageing"[tiab] OR "senescence"[tiab])
- Query A3 (reviews and perspectives on theories):
  ("theor* of aging"[tiab] OR "theor* of ageing"[tiab] OR "theories of aging"[tiab] OR "evolution of ageing"[tiab] OR "evolution of aging"[tiab])
  OR (("Aging"[Majr]) AND (Review[pt] OR "Perspective"[tiab] OR "Conceptual"[tiab]) AND (theor*[tiab] OR framework*[tiab]))
- Combine A1–A3 with OR to maximize recall.

Stage B: Precision filters (subtract likely false positives)
- Exclude topical domains prone to false positives unless paired with explicit theory terms:
  NOT (cosmetic*[tiab] OR sunscreen*[tiab] OR "facial"[tiab] OR dermatol*[tiab])
  NOT ("healthy aging"[tiab] OR "resilience"[tiab] OR wellbeing[tiab] OR "public health"[tiab] OR "policy"[tiab] OR "care"[tiab])
  NOT ("religion"[tiab] OR "sociolog*"[tiab] OR "humanities"[tiab])
  NOT ("gait"[tiab] OR "walking while talking"[tiab] OR athlete*[tiab])
  NOT ("model organism"[tiab] OR "animal model"[tiab])
- If the project’s scope is biological senescence, consider:
  NOT ("Psychological Theory"[mh]) 
  NOT ("Healthy Aging"[mh]) 
  NOT ("Cosmetics"[mh])
  AND NOT ("Skin"[mh] OR "Dermatology"[mh])
- To reduce organ/disease-only papers, optionally dampen results that mention only one organ without theory cues (post-retrieval, see Classification Rules).

Stage C: Enrichment terms (optional boosts for recall with acceptable precision)
- Add OR blocks with canonical names and key authors:
  (“Medawar” OR “Williams” OR “Hamilton” OR “Kirkwood” OR “disposable soma” OR “antagonistic pleiotropy” OR “hyperfunction” OR “programmatic aging” OR “quasi-program” OR “epigenetic clock theory” OR “complex systems” OR “entropy” OR “thermodynamic” OR “information theory” OR “free radical theory” OR “mitochondrial theory”)

Stage D: Post-retrieval screening
- Apply the decision rules/ML classifier (below) to Title/Abstract/MeSH/full text where available.
- Keep dual pipeline: (1) biological aging theory; (2) social/psychological aging theory (if needed), to avoid conflation.


6) CLASSIFICATION RULES: decision process after retrieval

Labels
- BA-Theory: Biological aging theory (ultimate/proximate/integrative).
- SA-Theory: Social/psychological aging theory (valid theory of aging in a non-biological domain).
- Not-Theory: Not an aging theory (may be aging-related).

Rule-based decision tree (deterministic first pass)
1. Does the paper explicitly propose, refine, or critically assess a general explanatory account for why and/or how senescence occurs that is intrinsic, progressive, and deleterious and is intended to generalize at least within a species (preferably broader)? Evidence: theory framing, connection to recognized theory families, general scope beyond single organ/disease.
   - Yes → proceed to 2
   - No → Not-Theory
2. Domain disambiguation:
   - Biological (mechanistic/evolutionary/complex-systems; organism-level scope) → BA-Theory
   - Social/psychological/cultural (aging experience/behavior/roles) → SA-Theory
3. Exclusion checks for BA-Theory:
   - If scope is limited to one organ/disease without claims to general senescence causation → Not-Theory (even if “theory/model” appears).
   - If paper is primarily a method/metric/biomarker/clinical management/policy without proposing general senescence causation → Not-Theory.
   - If mathematical mortality models lack biological/evolutionary mechanisms for senescence → Not-Theory.
4. Inclusion checks (positive signals for BA-Theory):
   - Explicit theory names or families (e.g., free radical, redox, disposable soma, antagonistic pleiotropy, hyperfunction, telomere, information, entropy/thermodynamics, complex-systems dysregulation).
   - Integrates ultimate and proximate causes or offers organism-level predictions (e.g., CR/PR and entropy; idx 10).
   - Cross-species reasoning or species-general logic; explicit claims to universality within species.

- Not-Theory (filter out for biological theory searches):
  - 10.1371/journal.pone.0233384 (idx 1 negative), 10.1098/rstb.2019.0727 (idx 8, sociality-and-longevity theme-issue intro), 10.1038/s41556-022-01062-z (idx 10), 10.15171/apb.2019.042 (idx 11), 10.1111/acel.14283 (idx 17), 10.1097/GOX.0b013e31828ed1da (idx 18), 10.1093/gerona/glae210 (idx 19), 10.1055/a-1761-8481 (idx 20), 10.1038/s41398-024-03004-9 (idx 21), 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61489-0 (idx 22), 10.1007/s11904-010-0041-9 (idx 23), 10.1177/0022034510377791 (idx 24), 10.1007/humrep/deg377 (idx 25).

ML/AI augmentation (after rule-based triage)
- Train a supervised classifier on labeled positives (BA-Theory) and negatives provided, using Title/Abstract/MeSH and full text where available.
  - Features: embeddings (e.g., SciBERT), presence of theory-family lexicon, cross-species cues, “ultimate/proximate,” generality signals; negative lexicon for cosmetics, policy, wellbeing, single-organ terms.
  - Calibrate with human-in-the-loop review for disputed/edge cases (e.g., thermodynamic models vs generic mortality models).
- A simple ensemble: deterministic rules (above) for high precision, plus ML to improve recall on cases lacking obvious “theory” keywords.


Summary: What separates true biological aging theory from look-alikes
- True theory papers explain organismal senescence via general intrinsic mechanisms or evolutionary logic, articulate scope beyond a single system, and connect to established theory families, often making testable or integrative claims.
- False positives are commonly: organ/disease-specific; applied/public health; measurement/method; or generic models without biological causal claims for senescence.
