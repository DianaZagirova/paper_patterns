  "title": "The hyperfunction theory: An emerging paradigm for the biology of aging",
  "abstract": "The process of senescence (aging) is predominantly determined by the action of wild-type genes. For most organisms, this does not reflect any adaptive function that senescence serves, but rather evolutionary effects of declining selection against genes with deleterious effects later in life. To understand aging requires an account of how evolutionary mechanisms give rise to pathogenic gene action and late-life disease, that integrates evolutionary (ultimate) and mechanistic (proximate) causes into a single explanation. A well-supported evolutionary explanation by G.C. Williams argues that senescence can evolve due to pleiotropic effects of alleles with antagonistic effects on fitness and late-life health (antagonistic pleiotropy, AP). What has remained unclear is how gene action gives rise to late-life disease pathophysiology. One ultimate-proximate account is T.B.L. Kirkwood's disposable soma theory. Based on the hypothesis that stochastic molecular damage causes senescence, this reasons that aging is coupled to reproductive fitness due to preferential investment of resources into reproduction, rather than somatic maintenance. An alternative and more recent ultimate-proximate theory argues that aging is largely caused by programmatic, developmental-type mechanisms. Here ideas about AP and programmatic aging are reviewed, particularly those of M.V. Blagosklonny (the hyperfunction theory) and J.P. de Magalhães (the developmental theory), and their capacity to make sense of diverse experimental findings is assessed.",

    "Introduction": "As a field, the biology of senescence (aging) is lacking in terms of a core explanatory framework or paradigm such as that possessed by chemistry or genetics (Gems and de Magalhães, 2021). This review surveys an emerging set of ideas which for convenience will be referred to here as the programmatic theory. These ideas offer a new account of the proximate mechanisms of antagonistic pleiotropy, an important evolutionary-genetic principle in the biology of aging (Williams, 1957).\n\nDevising effective explanations of senescence as a whole is a challenge that has, unfortunately, defeated biogerontologists. Why is aging so difficult to understand? Arguably, there are two reasons in particular. First, because it is a multifactorial process, as reflected in the fact that diseases of aging are largely multifactorial in terms of their etiology. Thus, any individual theory about a given senescent etiology will be insufficient to explain the whole phenomenon. Second, because the relative contribution of the factors that together cause aging is variable and context dependent, differing according to the senescent pathology considered, to environmental conditions and type of organism (Ezcurra et al., 2018; Gems and de Magalhães, 2021).\n\nThough this presents a difficult challenge, it does not mean that senescence is impossible to understand. Though aging is a multifactorial process, a plausible hope is that the number of individual factors involved is relatively small, particularly when viewed in terms of broad determinative principles. Moreover, given the common evolutionary origins of animal species, these principles are likely to be operative in diverse organisms. Thus, the challenge for biogerontology is to understand these individual principles, and how they combine to cause aging-related disease, and aging as a whole (Gems and de Magalhães, 2021).\n\nWhile attempts to understand aging from the 1990s onwards were strongly focused on the role of accumulation of molecular damage as a cause of aging, earlier accounts tended to be more broadly multifactorial (Comfort, 1979; Cutler, 1984; Dilman, 1994; Finch, 1990; Strehler, 1977). Multifactorial models, particularly that of Vladimir Dilman, will be discussed later in this article. In the meantime, it should be emphasized that programmatic mechanisms and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) as described here are elements of a wider, multifactorial process.\n\nIn the following discussion I will first introduce the concept of AP, as described by George Williams, and then go on to describe attempts to explain AP in terms of actual biological mechanisms (e.g. biochemical, cellular, developmental) that form a pathophysiological basis of the process of senescence. These include Tom Kirkwood’s disposable soma theory, Misha Blagosklonny’s hyperfunction theory, João Pedro de Magalhães’s developmental theory, and Vladimir Dilman’s ontogenetic theory. The latter three theories share key features, and can be referred to collectively as the programmatic theory. For definitions of key terms, see the glossary.\n\n",
    "The evolution of aging": "Diseases of aging are strange in that their principal etiology is not any of the usual suspects that disrupt normal function (infectious pathogens, mechanical injury, mutation, toxins etc), but rather the process of evolution. Natural selection favors individuals that leave the largest number of surviving offspring, not necessarily those that live the longest. With advancing age after the onset of reproduction, natural selection weakens with the result that new alleles that impair health in later life are more likely to escape selection and accumulate in populations, causing aging (Medawar, 1952). The causes of this selection shadow can include extrinsic factors (e.g. predation, starvation) that increase mortality disproportionately in later life (Abrams, 1993; Hamilton, 1966; Moorad et al., 2019).\n\n",
    "The evolution of aging - Antagonistic pleiotropy as a cause of aging": "How might gene variants with bad effects on late-life health act? Here there are two ideas. First, they could be harmful mutations with effects that do not appear until late life. A suggested example is Huntington’s disease, which does not develop until mid-life, as the selection shadow deepens. This could explain its relatively high prevalence, despite being caused by a dominant mutation (Haldane, 1941). This instantiates the mutation accumulation theory of the evolution of aging (Medawar, 1952). Here, the harmful alleles that natural selection fails to eliminate and which cause aging are very much akin to disease-causing mutations, such as those causing Marfan syndrome or hemochromatosis. According to the mutation accumulation theory aging is a form of genetic disease, arising from a multiplicity of late-acting mutations.\n\nSecond, they may be gene variants that provide a fitness benefit in early life, but also promote pathology in later life. Due to the selection shadow, fitness benefits may outweigh the later detriment, resulting in the allele spreading through the population (Williams, 1957)(Fig. 1A). Here the new allele displays pleiotropy, i.e. has several effects, that are opposite in terms of impact on fitness, i.e. antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Given that AP genes provide fitness benefits and are present due to positive selection, they cannot be viewed as defective or mutant; rather they are, in genetic terms, wild type. Thus, insofar as they are caused by AP genes, diseases of aging are genetic diseases arising from effects of the wild-type genome. The idea that normal gene function can cause disease might, from a medical perspective, seem a contradiction in terms. But evolutionary theory, now well supported empirically (Austad and Hoffman, 2018; Byars and Voskarides, 2020; Carter and Nguyen, 2011; Zhao and Promislow, 2019), tells us that normal genes can cause late-life pathology and diseases of aging. Such genes may be referred to as gerontogenes (Johnson and Lithgow, 1992).\n\nThis is a fundamental principle of pathophysiology critical for understanding late-life disease. Yet its utility is limited by the current lack of understanding of the actual biological mechanisms (biochemical, cellular, physiological) by which AP genes exert their effects. What is needed here is an account of the determinants of aging that encompasses both ultimate, evolutionary mechanisms and proximate, biological mechanisms into a single integrated understanding. Two such ultimate-proximate accounts of the causes of aging are the disposable soma theory and the programmatic theory.\n\n",
    "Ultimate-proximate theory 1. Disposable soma: where damage causes aging": "For many years a popular hypothesis about aging has been that its principal cause is the accumulation of random molecular damage (Harman, 1956; Shore and Ruvkun, 2013; Zimniak, 2008). The causes of molecular damage to biomolecules are diverse, ranging from DNA replication errors to glycation of proteins (Holliday, 1997; Rattan, 2008), but particular attention was paid to damage arising from reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as the superoxide (O2\n-) free radical produced as a by-product of oxidative metabolism (Beckman and Ames, 1998). If molecular damage causes aging it follows that the level of cellular maintenance that prevents damage accumulation is an important determinant of aging rate, and that the genetic determination of lifespan is likely to involve regulation of cellular maintenance mechanisms (Holliday, 1997; Partridge and Gems, 2006). In short, aging rate reflects the balance between stochastic damage accumulation and somatic maintenance levels (the damage/maintenance paradigm) (Fig. 1B).\n\nThe observation that cellular maintenance processes are costly in resource terms led to the deduction that trade-offs might exist between cellular maintenance and reproductive effort. Given limited resource availability in the wild, optimization of the trade-off would inevitably lead to levels of cellular maintenance below those necessary to entirely prevent damage accumulation. The result of this is a rapidly aging, disposable soma, in contrast to the immortal, non-aging germline (Kirkwood, 2005; Kirkwood, 1977) (Fig. 1C).\n\nThe disposable soma (DS) theory provides a clear and logical account of how trade-offs could arise between fitness traits at different points in the life history: early benefit (increased reproduction) and later cost (increased mortality due to gradual damage accumulation). Though not originally conceived as such (Armstrong, 2019) it provides a cogent explanation for the proximate mechanisms of AP gene action (Kirkwood and Rose, 1991). Yet despite its elegance, the DS theory remains unproven, and some experimental findings argue against it (Grandison et al., 2009; Piper et al., 2017; Zajitschek et al., 2019). One limitation is its dependence upon the damage/maintenance paradigm. While molecular damage, DNA damage in particular (Schumacher et al., 2021), is certainly a primary causal mechanism in some forms of senescent pathology (e.g. cancer), for many others this is far from clear (see below). While it is possible that DS effects could exacerbate pathologies where damage is a major driver, their importance as a major cause of aging currently seems unlikely (discussed further below) (Blagosklonny, 2007b; Blagosklonny, 2010e). But while its explanatory utility remains uncertain, as the first ultimate-proximate model, the DS theory was important in providing a template for the development of ultimate-proximate theories.\n\n",
    "Ultimate-proximate theory 2. Where aging is programmatic": "In the early 2000s it became increasingly clear that the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS)/ mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) network can control aging rate across a range of organisms (Gems and Partridge, 2001; Kenyon, 2010). Discovering the IIS/mTOR-regulated, downstream mechanisms of aging itself promised to provide fundamental insights into the nature of senescence. Guided by contemporary beliefs, early attempts to understand this guessed that wild-type IIS accelerated aging by reducing somatic maintenance (e.g. antioxidant defense) thereby increasing reproductive output, consistent with the DS theory (Fontana et al., 2010; Gems and McElwee, 2005; Holzenberger et al., 2003; Honda and Honda, 1999; Kirkwood, 2005; Lithgow and Walker, 2002; Partridge and Gems, 2002b; Vanfleteren, 1993) (Fig. 1D). However, experimental findings during the same period were starting to raise doubts about the assumption that molecular damage is a primary cause of aging, particularly oxidative damage (Bjelakovic et al., 2007; Chong et al., 2007; Howes, 2006; Keaney and Gems, 2003; Keaney et al., 2004).\n\nAgainst this background, two biogerontologists independently saw a way to rearrange existing concepts and findings into a new ultimate-proximate theory that is very different to DS. Although initial accounts of the theory, put forward by João Pedro de Magalhães (de Magalhães and Church, 2005) and Mikhail (Misha) Blagosklonny (Blagosklonny, 2006a), differ in emphasis and in detail, they have the same conceptual core (the programmatic theory). de Magalhães and Blagosklonny each put forward many ideas, some more persuasive than others; the following account of the framework of ideas centered on the programmatic theory is to a certain extent my own synthesis of their ideas.\n\n",
    "Ultimate-proximate theory 2. Where aging is programmatic - The core programmatic theory": "Growth hormone (GH), IIS and mTOR are part of a nutrient-sensitive signaling network that promotes growth, development and aging. This suggests that growth and development somehow cause aging. But three lines of reasoning initially seemed to argue against this deduction. First, it suggests that there is a program for aging, implying that aging is a purposeful adaptation; but according to evolutionary theory aging is non-adaptive, and therefore not programmed (Austad, 2004; Kirkwood, 2005; Partridge and Gems, 2002b). Second, growth and development are not obviously linked to somatic maintenance and molecular damage accumulation, which was assumed to be the main cause of senescence. Third, it is difficult to see how growth processes can limit lifespan. The programmatic theory provides answers to each of these three objections.\n\nFirst, the program problem. Here it is helpful to consider Williams’ own initial thoughts about how AP might work at the level of gene function, which involve a hypothetical gene for calcium deposition. A new allele appears that increases Ca2+ deposition during bone development, and thereby promotes fitness (e.g. by aiding escape from predators); in later life, its continued action promotes Ca2+ deposition into blood vessel walls, contributing to arteriosclerosis (Fig. 2A) (Williams, 1957). In principle, a mechanism could evolve to switch off calcium deposition, but due to the selection shadow it does not. Here, an evolved function of a gene continues or runs on in a futile fashion in later life causing pathology. The principle involved here is notably different to the DS theory. If this can occur for the function of structural genes of this sort, why not for regulatory genes controlling entire developmental programs and involving action of large numbers of regulated genes (Fig. 2B)?\n\nEvolutionary theory rules out biological programs for aging (i.e. aging as an adaptation) for most species, but not programmatic or program-like mechanisms that promote senescence (Blagosklonny, 2007c; de Magalhães and Church, 2005). Part of the confusion arises because the word program here has two meanings. On the one hand it can mean a genetically-determined and complex process involving changes in gene expression, cellular function, tissue composition etc (programmed in the mechanistic sense); on the other hand it can mean a program for something that promotes fitness (programmed in the adaptive sense) (Galimov et al., 2019). Aided by this disambiguation, the new theory is able to argue that in later life programmatic changes occur that are programmed in the mechanistic but not the adaptive sense, or as Blagosklonny describes them, quasi-programmed (Blagosklonny, 2006a). The derived noun quasi-program, describing a programmatic, pathogenic entity, is particularly helpful for discussion of programmatic pathophysiology.\n\nTo explain the quasi-program concept, Blagosklonny employs various homely analogies. For example, one wants hot water for tea and so boils some in a saucepan. If, having taken the water, one leaves the saucepan on the hot stove, the pan will become damaged. Here a purposeful program for preparing hot water becomes a futile quasi-program for damaging the saucepan (Blagosklonny, 2006a). In living organisms later-life off switches for developmental programs are often absent because of declining selection in later life (Blagosklonny, 2006a; Williams, 1957). Similarly, de Magalhães uses the analogy of a program to build a house, and imagines a carpet layer working on pointlessly after completion of the program: “ever-increasing layers of carpets will eventually prevent doors from opening, and ultimately, nobody will be able to get in or out of the house” (de Magalhães, 2012). This starts to explain how growth promotion by IIS/mTOR can promote aging: they promote both developmental programs and senescence-promoting quasi-programs (Blagosklonny, 2006a; de Magalhães and Church, 2005).\n\nBut what about molecular damage? de Magalhães and Blagosklonny both suggest that the assumption that aging is largely and primarily caused by accumulation of molecular damage is incorrect (Blagosklonny, 2006a; de Magalhães and Church, 2005). As Blagosklonny articulates it, the primary mechanisms of aging do not involve loss of function, but rather the opposite: too much function or, as he puts it, hyperfunction, driven by wild-type gene action. This claim challenges the entrenched assumption that aging is fundamentally a passive process of system failure and breakdown. Thinking of mTOR effects in particular, Blagosklonny argues that it is the opposite: an active, self-destructive process.\n\nFinally, how can processes of growth and development lead to disease? Broadly speaking, the programmatic theory argues that developmental changes in adulthood, including late-life continuation of developmental programs, is pathogenic, causing disruption of tissue and organ function. Several examples of simple forms of developmental run-on follow. Presbyopia is a type of long-sightedness that increases with age. Its cause is continued, futile growth of the lens during adulthood, leading to a gradual increase in lens thickness (Strenk et al., 2005). In men, the prostate gland typically exhibits a gradual increase in size as a response to long term exposure to dihydrotestosterone. This leads eventually to benign prostatic hyperplasia (Nacusi and Tindall, 2011; Waters et al., 2000) and increased risk of prostate cancer, a major cause of age-related death in men (Untergasser et al., 2005). In a third example, this time hypothetical, the process of synaptic pruning in the brain that promotes cognitive development runs on in later life, leading to age-related cognitive decline (De Magalhaes and Sandberg, 2005). A final example affects babirusas, a type of wild pig found in Indonesia. Adult males have curved, tusk-like maxillary canine teeth that point backwards up over the snout. These continue to grow until in some cases the backward curve of their growth trajectory drives them into the cranium, sometimes piercing it through (Macdonald, 2018). Here, in each case, continuation of normal, wild-type growth leads to pathology. However, most aging-related diseases are etiologically multi-factorial, and contributions of programmatic etiologies more complex (described below).\n\nA simplified scheme of the programmatic theory is shown in Fig. 2C. Beyond these core tenets, Blagosklonny and de Magalhães have each contributed additional ideas, which extend and strengthen the theorem. For example, Blagosklonny elaborates upon how quasi-programs affect lifespan and disease, and makes pointed critiques of various concepts arising from the damage/maintenance paradigm, while de Magalhães integrates the programmatic theory conceptually with earlier developmental theories of aging, and explores evolutionary mechanisms beyond AP and IIS/mTOR that contribute to programmatic aging. Ideas from these two commentators will be discussed in turn.\n\n",
    "Mikhail Blagosklonny - Blagosklonny’s research approach": "To understand Blagosklonny’s thinking it is helpful to know something about his background and approach. Unlike most biogerontologists, he has a clinical background (M.D. in internal medicine, Ph.D. in experimental medicine and cardiology). He is a proponent and practitioner of conceptual research, which uses explorations of the scientific literature to develop new hypotheses and to test them, sometimes repurposing existing data to draw new conclusions in ways unintended by the original researchers (Blagosklonny, 2007d; Blagosklonny and Pardee, 2002). He initially applied this approach for research in experimental oncology, including a focus on anti-cancer drug action (Blagosklonny, 2005a; Blagosklonny, 2005b; Blagosklonny, 2005c). An interest in the potential of the drug rapamycin as an anti-cancer agent (Blagosklonny and Darzynkiewicz, 2002) led him to the idea that this drug might act by inhibiting aging. This led in turn to the question of the causes of aging itself, and a re-examination of central ideas in biogerontology, both ultimate (e.g. antagonistic pleiotropy, disposable soma) and proximate (e.g. molecular damage accumulation, telomere shortening).\n\nA strength of conceptual research is the relative ease of combining findings and concepts from different scientific disciplines, for example between basic and clinical research fields (Blagosklonny, 2003b), enabling broader insights. Blagosklonny’s conclusions draw extensively from both biogerontological sources and, importantly, clinical literature on age-related disease; thus, his ideas are more strongly grounded in contemporary research findings (including clinical findings) than in traditional theories about aging. They are also influenced by earlier ideas developed in Russia in the 1970-80s (Dilman, 1994) (discussed further below).\n\nGiven that the starting point of the work was to understand the action of rapamycin, his perspective is highly focused on this drug and the protein that it inhibits, mTOR (Blagosklonny, 2007a; Blagosklonny, 2010b; Blagosklonny, 2012c; Blagosklonny, 2014b; Blagosklonny, 2019a), which restricts its scope somewhat. However, his arguments are often applicable (and applied) to the broader endocrine and signalling network that regulates development and growth, including GH and IIS. In many of his discussions, the aging process that he describes is the set of processes controlled by GH/IIS/mTOR which, as he sometimes emphasises, is not the entire aging process.\n\nKey to the initial development of Blagosklonny’s theorem was his realization that growth stimulation leads rapidly to cellular senescence when the cell cycle is arrested, with no involvement of molecular damage (Blagosklonny, 2003a). (Note here that cellular senescence, as defined by Hayflick, should not be confused with the broader phenomenon of senescence). His main ideas are set out in three early essays (Blagosklonny, 2006a; Blagosklonny, 2007b; Blagosklonny, 2008b), particularly the first of these. He then produced a very long series of follow-up essays (over 60), some derived from additional conceptual research with newer findings, and some responding to individual new papers. Many of these essays argue that an mTOR hyperfunction model better explains published findings than the conventional damage-based view, and often include explanatory reiterations of his version of the programmatic theory. The repetition to an extent reflects the lack of response to his work from other biogerontologists; “Repetitio est mater studiorum” as he notes at one point (Blagosklonny, 2018b). Some present new elaborations and additions to the theory, e.g. (Blagosklonny, 2007c; Blagosklonny, 2009b; Blagosklonny, 2010c; Blagosklonny, 2010d; Blagosklonny, 2018a; Blagosklonny, 2019b). For brief summaries of the content of 68 of his essays, see Table 1. The essays draw to some extent on his own laboratory work, mostly on the regulation of cellular senescence, see e.g. (Demidenko et al., 2009a; Demidenko and Blagosklonny, 2008; Demidenko and Blagosklonny, 2009; Demidenko et al., 2010; Demidenko et al., 2009b; Leontieva and Blagosklonny, 2016; Leontieva et al., 2015; Leontieva et al., 2012a; Leontieva et al., 2012b). At times they seem written in haste, as if painted with rough brushstrokes, but what they sometimes lack in polish they often make up for in originality and creative insight. Key elements of Blagosklonny’s framework of ideas, beyond the core programmatic theory include the following.\n\n",
    "Mikhail Blagosklonny - How do quasi-programs promoted by IIS/mTOR limit lifespan?": "Aging is a deteriorative process that causes decline and death, but how? The core programmatic AP account provides a cause, but does not explain how it leads to life-limiting harm. It is here that Blagosklonny in particular sheds light, helped by three basic ideas that combine to give a very different view of aging to that which is traditional in biogerontology. First, that death due to aging is caused by disease. Second, that aging results from a nested series of life-limiting etiologies. Third, that programmatic AP promoted by IIS/mTOR causes life-limiting disease in a largely non-cell autonomous manner.\n\n",
    "Mikhail Blagosklonny - Blagosklonny on the attack": "In many of his essays, Blagosklonny uses conceptual research to compare how well damage-based and programmatic theories do at explaining findings past and present. Overall, these find in favor of the latter, and support critiques of several traditional biogerontological claims and concepts, which he sometimes pokes fun at for their perceived inadequacies.\n\n",
    "João Pedro de Magalhães": "The programmatic theory reconciles a mechanistic theory based on developmental change with the AP theory, and provides an account of IIS/mTOR action on aging. But both developmental changes during aging, and AP are wider phenomena, as has been emphasized (Maklakov and Chapman, 2019), and all causes of aging is a wider category still. de Magalhães, originally from Portugal and now at the University of Liverpool, gives some consideration to programmatic etiologies in the broader sense (de Magalhães and Church, 2005), and explores issues relating to the programmatic theory that Blagosklonny touches on more briefly or not at all, including the following. How does the programmatic theory relate to earlier developmental theories of aging? And: how does it relate to epigenetic changes during adulthood?\n\n",
    "João Pedro de Magalhães - From developmental theories to the programmatic theory": "Over the years it has often been suggested that aging is a form of developmental abnormality, resulting e.g. from increased or decreased gene silencing, transcriptional deregulation, dysdifferentiation or overdifferentiation (de Magalhães and Church, 2005). Certain broad characteristics of aging are suggestive of its developmental nature. For example, different mammals (e.g. mice vs humans) differ greatly in terms of rate of development, timing of maturity, and of appearance of many of the same diseases of aging (e.g. cancer, osteoporosis, cataracts) (de Magalhães and Church, 2005). This is also true of the gradual age-dependent decline in cognitive function (De Magalhaes and Sandberg, 2005). Moreover, across mammalian species the ratio between time from conception to sexual maturity and adult lifespan is approximately constant, at about 1:4 (Charnov, 1993), suggesting a possible mechanistic relationship between development rate and adult lifespan (de Magalhães and Church, 2005). Similarly, the complex and stereotyped nature of many manifestations of senescence (e.g. atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, male pattern baldness) seem more consistent with programmatic pathophysiology than random molecular damage (Blagosklonny, 2006a).\n\nWhile it is clear that both stochastic damage and programmatic changes contribute to senescence, in terms of their relative importance these are competing theories. The former predominated during recent decades, but less so prior to that. For example, as de Magalhães points out (de Magalhães, 2012), the discovery of effects of DR on aging, initially in fruit flies and rats, arose from the idea that slow growth rate results in slower aging (McCay and Crowell, 1934; Northrop, 1917; Osborne et al., 1917; Park, 2010), including Bidder’s hypothesis (Bidder, 1932). Later work showing that although life-long DR limits growth, adult-limited DR was sufficient to extend lifespan in fully grown mice (Weindruch and Walford, 1982) appeared to argue against the developmental theory; however, it is consistent with stunting of quasi-programs during adulthood.\n\nSimilarly, in chico (insulin receptor substrate) mutant fruit flies with reduced IIS, increased lifespan is seen in both chico homozygotes and heterozygotes, but only the homozygotes exhibit reduced body size (Clancy et al., 2001; Tu et al., 2002). Thus, chico mutant longevity is not caused by their reduced body size (Gems and Partridge, 2001), suggesting that reduced growth does not slow aging; however, these results, again, do not rule out suppression of quasi-programs during adulthood. In fact, chico-/+\n heterozygote females show reduced egg production (Clancy et al., 2001), consistent with biosynthetic (and programmatic) insufficiency.\n\nArguably, the confusion here stems partly from ambiguities arising from the words growth and development. Simply understood these refer to changes occurring during ontogenesis that largely cease at sexual maturity. A metric of growth is adult body size, and to speak of growth after maturation in organisms with determinate growth, after they have stopped growing, makes little sense. But in the programmatic model, growth pathways promote quasi-program progression, or “twisted growth” as it has been described (Blagosklonny, 2008b) during adulthood. Similarly, development. A quasi-program is defined as “a program for development that has not been turned off” (Blagosklonny, 2006a). Yet it is clear that what is meant here is development in the sense of all complex programs involving growth and differentiative change: not only those of ontogenesis, but also for example those involved in reproduction and tissue repair and remodelling during adulthood (c.f. the role of “senescent” fibroblasts in wound healing) (Demaria et al., 2014). To avoid this confusion the term programmatic theory is used here, rather than developmental theory as previously (Maklakov and Chapman, 2019). This avoids confusion with earlier developmental theories of aging, and over the meaning of development, and also alludes to the reconciliation of ultimate and proximate perspectives in the theory.\n\n",
    "João Pedro de Magalhães - From the programmatic theory to epigenetic aging and biological clocks": "A recent topic of interest among biogerontologists has been epigenetic changes during adulthood (Benayoun et al., 2015; Horvath and Raj, 2018). de Magalhães notes studies showing similarities between changes in gene expression occurring during development and aging (Lui et al., 2010; Somel et al., 2010; Takasugi, 2011) as evidence that drivers of epigenetic change are programmatic rather than stochastic (de Magalhães, 2012). As a developmental process, quasi-program execution is expected to involve epigenetic change. Thus, the programmatic theory provides an explanation in terms of ultimate and proximate causes for epigenetic changes in aging (though this does not rule out the action of other contributory mechanisms).\n\nThe question of how biological time is marked during aging is central to biogerontology, and many forms of clock have been proposed. These include a metabolic clock in the rate-of-living theory (Pearl, 1928), a telomere shortening replicometer in replicative senescence (Olovnikov, 1996), and epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation (Horvath, 2013; Horvath and Raj, 2018). According to the programmatic theory, the major aging clock is a developmental one. de Magalhães sees epigenetic changes as likely to arise from the ticking of a developmental clock (de Magalhães, 2012), whose speed is increased by IIS/mTOR (de Magalhães and Church, 2005). Consistent with this, the methylation clock is slowed by conditions in which mTOR is inhibited (Blagosklonny, 2018a), for example in mice treated with rapamycin, in long-lived Ames (Prop1), Snell (Pit1), and Laron (Ghr) dwarf mutant mice with defective GH signaling (Cole et al., 2017; Consortium, 2021; Petkovich et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017), and in rapamycin-treated cultured human fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Horvath et al., 2019; Matsuyama et al., 2019). Moreover, mTOR functions in circadian clocks, underscoring the role of mTOR in setting the pace of biological time (Blagosklonny, 2018a).\n\nThe developmental basis of epigenetic changes during adulthood in mammals has received further support from recent work by Steve Horvath and colleagues. Of particular note, methylation clocks mark time during embryogenesis and postnatal development as well as (running much more slowly) during adulthood, and clock methylation sites are strongly associated with genes specifying developmental processes. The latter include those under regulation of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC), including multiple Hox genes, leading to the conclusion that “the essence of the aging process itself is an integral part of, and the consequence of the development of life” (Raj and Horvath, 2020). The link between clock methylation sites and PRC-regulated genes was also recently seen in a universal mammalian methylation clock, implying evolutionary conservation of developmental clock mechanisms (Consortium, 2021).\n\nAlmost a century ago, Raymond Pearl attributed rate-of-living effects, as seen in effects of ambient temperature on lifespan in poikilotherms (e.g. Drosophila, C. elegans)(Klass, 1977; Loeb and Northrop, 1917) to metabolic rate (Pearl, 1928), an idea that was subsequently linked to the ROS theory (Sohal and Weindruch, 1996). The programmatic theory suggests instead that effects of temperature on both development and aging reflects a change in the rate of developmental processes.\n\n",
    "Vladimir Dilman: programmatic aging within a multifactorial model": "As emphasized in the opening of this essay, antagonistic pleiotropy and programmatic mechanisms are clearly not the sole cause of aging. To close, I will present a sketch of a model of the whole aging process, derived from a scheme originally developed in the 1980s by Vladimir Dilman, but modified here in the light of recent advances. Dilman, who died in 1994, was a preeminent gerontologist and clinician in the U.S.S.R., in many ways the Soviet Union’s equivalent to thoughtful biogerontologists in the West such as Alex Comfort, Bernard Strehler, Richard Cutler and Caleb Finch, but his theories are little known outside Russia. He was also the father of Misha Blagosklonny.\n\n",
    "Vladimir Dilman: programmatic aging within a multifactorial model - Dilman’s ontogenetic and four models theories": "Dilman argues that, overall, aging and age-related disease are etiologically multifactorial, and attributable to four distinct disease models: ecological, genetic, accumulational and ontogenetic (Dilman, 1994) (Chapter 11) (Fig. 6A). Ecological here is in the sense used by Frederic Ludwig to describe the main disease model in medicine, where diseases result from harmful extrinsic factors ranging from infectious pathogens to dietary toxins (Ludwig, 1980). Genetic here refers to inherited genetic diseases, rather than somatic mutations or pathogenic action of wild-type genes. The accumulational model includes molecular damage accumulation, but also other types of pathogenic accumulative processes. The ontogenetic model involves the continued action of developmental processes in later life promoting senescence.\n\nAccording to this four models scheme, mean lifespan and inter-individual variation in lifespan is largely attributable to ecological and genetic determinants, and maximum lifespan to accumulational and, particularly, ontogenetic determinants. While Dilman’s ontogenetic model clearly prefigures the programmatic theory, it was derived as a generalization from a now partially outdated theory about the control of aging by the hypothalamus. Briefly, this argued that aging is largely caused by programmed loss of hypothalamic sensitivity to feedback inhibition, leading to compensatory endocrine changes with pathogenic consequences, what he called hyperadaptosis (Dilman, 1984). The ontogenetic processes that he particularly refers to are those controlling systemic homeostasis in adulthood, namely energy metabolism (insulin), reproduction (estrogen) and adaptive systems (glucocorticoids).\n\nYet in amongst Dilman’s many ideas and reflections are key elements of the new programmatic theory, including the following. The ontogenetic model itself is prescient; as Dilman describes it: “the genetic program of an organism is not constructed according to the rule ‘from beginning to end,’ but proceeds ‘from a beginning, with the end unspecified’” (Dilman, 1994) (Chapter 6). He notes in passing the congruence between the ontogenetic model and antagonistic pleiotropy (Dilman, 1986). Like Blagosklonny, he emphatically rejects the distinction drawn between normal aging and age-related disease: “normal aging is a disease, or more precisely, a sum of diseases” (Dilman, 1994) (Chapter 6). Like de Magalhães, he emphasizes that ontogenetic etiologies are operative at a level above that of the cellular; however, he views the key level as systemic, while in the modern programmatic theory it is at all supra-cellular levels (from tissue microenvironment to systemic). By contrast, at the subcellular level, accumulative mechanisms are more important (e.g. DNA damage accumulation).\n\nAgain like de Magalhães, he views the fixity among mammals of the length of the developmental period as a proportion of total lifespan as support for the role of ontogenetic mechanisms in aging. Here he makes an interesting observation. The standard explanation for this constancy is that an increased selection shadow (e.g. due to increased extrinsic mortality) leads to the evolution of earlier sexual maturity and shorter lifespan, via independent mechanisms (earlier reproduction increases fitness, earlier selection shadow allows earlier senescence to evolve) (Charnov, 1993; Harvey and Purvis, 1999; Promislow, 1993). But Dilman wonders about the obverse situation, where longevity evolves to increase fitness via a longer reproductive span. He asks: given the independent mechanisms model, why should a delay in sexual maturity occur? More plausibly, longevity evolves through deceleration of the entire ontogenetic program, which slows both development and aging (Dilman, 1994) (Chapter 11); Blagosklonny later made a similar point (Blagosklonny, 2013a). According to this interpretation, the longer development time in humans relative to other higher primates evolved not due to any fitness benefit, but as a side-effect of selection for increased longevity, i.e. it is an unselected outcome of antagonistic pleiotropy, an evolutionary spandrel (Gould, 1997; Gould and Lewontin, 1979). Consistent with the ontogenetic model is the earlier puberty, accelerated cognitive decline and shorter lifespan in mice over-expressing growth hormone, and the converse effects in dwarf and DR mice (Chandrashekar et al., 2004).\n\nA major question raised by multifactorial models of aging is how the component factors interact with one another and here Dilman is, again, insightful. He argues that both ecological and accumulative factors can modulate ontogenetic aging, and that accumulational and ontogenetic mechanisms, though fundamentally independent are yet interwoven. He also suggests that stochastic damage may occur either in a wholly probabilistic fashion (as in somatic DNA damage accumulation), or as the result of genetically-determined programmatic mechanisms, what he refers to as “regular stochastic processes”. Here he has in mind ROS generated by mitochondrial metabolism. A recent case fitting this description is protein aggregation in C. elegans, resulting from a programmatic down-regulation of proteostatic mechanisms from around the time of sexual maturation (Labbadia and Morimoto, 2014).\n\n",
    "Vladimir Dilman: programmatic aging within a multifactorial model - A new multifactorial model based on Dilman’s four models": "While Dilman’s ontogenetic theory is a predecessor of the programmatic theory, one can, in a rather recursive fashion, modify and update his four models theory in the light of its newer descendent (Fig. 6B). First, by acknowledging the predominance of the wild-type genotype as the determinant and driver of programmatic mechanisms. This incorporates AP as a major determinative mechanism. Second, to unify ecological and genetic determinants into a single, broad category of causes apart from wild-type function. These represent the major causes of diseases in earlier life, where normal, wild-type function is disrupted. The rearranged scheme emphasizes the centrality of wild-type function, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment. If ecological and genetic factors were, by magic, eliminated, aging would still occur, and there would be little change in either the rate of acceleration of mortality with age (Gompertzian aging) or maximum lifespan. By contrast, if mechanisms of aging from wild-type function were removed, Gompertzian aging would be greatly reduced, though not, one assumes, entirely, due to accumulative mechanisms independent of wild-type function.\n\nThe role of inherited mutations in aging in this model requires further explanation. One proposed cause of aging, and mechanism of its evolution, is inherited mutations whose deleterious effects are expressed only later in life, as exemplified by Huntington’s disease (Haldane, 1941; Medawar, 1952). An unexplained feature of this mutation accumulation theory is the mechanism that causes a mutation to remain harmless throughout development and early adulthood, and then become harmful in later life. One possibility is that it is wild-type gene action and programmatic changes that cause the deleterious effects of such mutations to become expressed, or unmasked. Returning to the thought experiment again: according to the unmasking hypothesis, if one eliminated the wild-type gene action component from the revised Dilman model (Fig. 6B), a carrier of the Huntington mutation would not develop the disease.\n\nAn important feature of multifactorial models of aging, noted previously (Ezcurra et al., 2018; Gems and de Magalhães, 2021), is their highly context-dependent nature. For a given animal species, the relative contribution of different etiological factors will vary not only between different elements of senescence (e.g. different diseases of aging), but also between individuals. Moreover, the relative contribution of different factors may vary more broadly between species. For example, in humans, environmental, genetic, ontogenetic and accumulative factors all contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a major determinant of age-related death in humans. The relative importance of these factors will vary between individuals. In one, a major cause may be obesity, and increased cholesterol accumulation; in another, genetic predisposition (e.g. the APOE4 mutation), in a third, wild-type gene action may act alone. By contrast, the large uterine tumors that are invariably present in senescent C. elegans develop due to wholly programmatic mechanisms (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018b), consistent with the view that plastic, programmatic mechanisms play an exceptionally large role in aging in C. elegans (Gems et al., 2021; Lohr et al., 2019).\n\n",
    "Vladimir Dilman: programmatic aging within a multifactorial model - The ontogenesis of the programmatic theory": "Scientific discovery is rightly the object of wonder, something to marvel at. In my view, this applies to the programmatic theory. In the early 18th century a fierce priority dispute broke out between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz arguing over who invented calculus. The modern view is that this was silly, and that both men developed it independently. Such independent, simultaneous discoveries are quite common, and illustrate how scientific innovation is not so much a reflection of individual genius, as interactions of imaginative individuals with a collective and evolving fabric of knowledge. Once the fashion among scientists, these days I-said-it-first-ism risks being interpreted as a character weakness (principally, egotism).\n\nThe transpersonal nature of scientific thinking applies well to the programmatic theory, which has evolved over a long period, with certain key contributors. Dilman’s overall scheme, based around his hypothalamic model, was flawed and did not cohere well, yet included a number of prescient elements which contributed to Blagosklonny’s more compelling and better-supported theorem. Dilman himself noted similarities between his ontogenetic theory and Bidder’s hypothesis, formulated in the 1930s (Dilman, 1986). By contrast, de Magalhães’ version of the programmatic theory was developed without knowledge of either Dilman or Blagosklonny’s work. The possibility of the programmatic theory was, as it were, hanging in the air from the early 2000s, and both de Magalhães and Blagosklonny spotted it, with Blagosklonny developing it in more detail with respect to its capacity to explain the origins of disease. Yet the programmatic theory of the mid-2000s forms only part of a wider biology of aging, as discussed here and elsewhere (Gems et al., 2021; Lohr et al., 2019; Maklakov and Chapman, 2019). Of Dilman: he was in many ways ahead of his time and his work deserves greater recognition than it received during his lifetime (at least, outside Russia). He was noted for his creative and integrative thinking style (Napalkov, 2001), characteristics shared by Blagosklonny, and de Magalhães too.\n\n",
    "Concluding remarks": "The programmatic theory of aging as developed by Blagosklonny and de Magalhães promises to eventually serve as part of a general framework of understanding aging and the pathophysiology of late-life disease. This could at long last provide the field of biogerontology with an effective explanatory paradigm similar to that provided by the germ theory for the study of infectious disease, and the periodic table for chemistry. More work is needed to explore, test and expand this framework of ideas. This includes elements not discussed here, which will be the subjects of future essays, such as the concept of hypofunction (Maklakov and Chapman, 2019), biological constraint, how quasi-programs are initiated, and how quasi-programs interact in disease pathophysiology.\n\n"
